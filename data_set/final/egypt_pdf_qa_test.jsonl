Besides these fortunate travellers, however, there is another growing circle of those who are beginning to realize the significance of the early East in the history of man. As the Nile poured its life-giving waters into the broad bosom of the Mediterranean, so from the civilization of the wonderful people who so early emerged from barbarism on the Nile shores, there emanated and found their way to southern Europe rich and diversified influences of culture to which we of the western world are still indebted. Had the Euphrates flowed into the Mediterranean likewise, our debt to Babylon would have been correspondingly as great as that which we owe the Nile Valley.

For Egyptian religion as a whole, however, the author would acknowledge deep obligation to Erman’s admirable Handbuch, an obligation often indicated in the foot-notes, and elsewhere frequently evident to the technical reader. Although over twenty years old, Erman’s Aegypten is still the standard vade mecum on Egyptian life. It has often been of invaluable service in the production of this work. To Eduard Meyer’s exhaustive and final Chron- ologie I am, of course, indebted, especially in the earlier period. I would also gratefully acknowledge the clarify- ing influence of his incisive treatment of the Saitic age in his Geschichte des alten Aegyptens. To the colossal labors of Maspero and Wiedemann I have been indebted, especially in the bibliography, as indicated in the Preface to my Ancient Records, but I would gratefully indicate the obligation here also. Like all who work in Egyp- tian history, I also owe a debt to Winckler’s invaluable version of the Amarna Letters. For the illustrative materials, besides the published xiv PREFACE plates, frequently severally indicated, and his own photographs, the author would express his thanks to many friends and colleagues to whom he is indebted for photographs, drawings, or restorations. He is particu- larly indebted to his. friend Schaefer, of Berlin; also to Borchardt, Steindorff, Petrie, Zahn, Messerschmidt, Rev. W. MacGregor of Tamworth, and Dr. Caroline Ransom, for the unqualified use of photographs and reconstructions. To Messrs. Underwood & Underwood for permission to use a number of their superb stereo- graphs of Egyptian monuments 7n situ, I desire to express particular obligation. At the same time, may I add for the benefit of those to whom a journey through the Nile Valley is an impossibility, that the system of travel represented in these beautiful stereographsmakes possible to every one a voyage up the Nile which falls little short of the actual experience itself. Finally, I am not a little indebted to the great kindness of Mr. John Ward, of Lenoxvale, Belfast, for a magnificent series of photographs made specially for him, of recent excavations at Karnak, from which I was privileged to select a number, like the avenue of rams (Fig. 129).

Had the Euphrates flowed into the Mediterranean likewise, our debt to Babylon would have been correspondingly as great as that which we owe the Nile Valley. It is to Egypt that we must look as the dominant power in the Mediterranean basin, whether by force of arms or by sheer weight of superior civiliza- tion throughout the earliest career of man in southern Kurope, and for long after the archaic age had been supersededby higher culture. To us who are in civiliza- tion the children of early Europe, it is of vital interest to raise the curtain and peer beyond into the ages which bequeathed our forefathers so precious a legacy. Finally, vill PREFACE there is a third and possibly the most numerous class of those who desire an acquaintance with the history of Egypt, viz., the students of the Old Testament. All of these readers have been remembered in the composition of this book. The plan adopted in the production of this history is one which will in some measure also condition its use. The sources from which our knowledge of the early career of the Nile Valley peoples is drawn are of the meagerest extent, and most inadequate in character. They will be found further discussed herein (pp. 23 f.), and in the author’s Ancient Records of Egypt, Vol. I, pp. 3-22. As used at the present day, in the historical workshop of the scholar, they are accessible chiefly in published form. These publications were in the vast majority of cases edited before the attainment of such epigraphic accuracy and care as are now deemed in- dispensable in the production of such work.’ To copy an inscription of any kind with accuracy is not easy. So close and fine an observer of material documents as Ruskin could copy a short Latin inscription with sur- prising inaccuracy. In his incomparable Mornings in Florence he reproduces the brief inscription on the marble slab covering the tomb which he so admired in the church of Santa Croce; and in his copy of these eight short lines, which I compared with the original, he mis- spells ons word, and omits two entire words (‘‘et magister’’) of the medizval Latin.

PREFACE ix Politarch inscriptions appearedin eight different publica- tions, each of which diverges in some more or less im- portant respect from all the rest, before a correct copy was obtained. The Greek and Latin inscriptions on the bronze crab from the base of the New York Obelisk were long incorrectly read, and the mistake in the date led Mommsen to a false theory of the early Roman prefects of Egypt. In the early days of Egyptology, when a reading knowledge of hieroglyphic was still necessarily elementary, it required a copyist of ex- ceptional ability to produce a copy upon which much reliance can be placed at the present day. Had the science of Egyptology rapidly outgrown this early in- sufficiency, all would now be well; but such methods have continued down to the present day, and although many exhaustively accurate publications of hieroglyphic documents now appear with every year, it is neverthe- less true that the large majority of standard Egyptian documents accessible in publications exhibit a degree of incompleteness and inaccuracy not, in the author’s judgment, to be found in any other branch of epigraphic science. 3 Under these circumstances the author’s first obliga- tion has been to go behind the publications to the original monument itself in every possible instance. This task has consumed years and demanded protracted sojourn among the great collections of Europe. In this work a related enterprise has been of the greatest assistance. A mission to the museums of Europe to collect their Egyptian monuments for a Commission of the four Royal Academies of Germany (Berlin, Leipzig, Goettingen, and Munich), in order to make these documents available x PREFACE for a great Egyptian Dictionary endowed by the German Emperor, enabled the author to copy from the originals practically all the historical monuments of Egypt in Europe.", "question": "What historical theory was mistakenly formed due to an incorrect reading of inscriptions on the New York Obelisk's bronze crab?", "answer": "The incorrect reading of the Greek and Latin inscriptions on the bronze crab from the base of the New York Obelisk led Mommsen to a false theory regarding the early Roman prefects of Egypt."}

{"context": "PREFACE x4 any older translation or account of a document was consulted. The combined results of the revised copies from the originals and the new grammatical study of the documents have been embodied in a series of trans- lations of the historical documents, arranged in chrono- logical order, beginning with the earliest surviving records and continuing to the final loss of Egyptian national independence at the conquest by the Persians in 525 B.C. Supplied with historical introductions and explanatory notes, the original documents, otherwise scattered through hundreds on hundreds of inaccessible publications, are thus accessible in English to the reader who desires to know upon what documentary evidence a particular assertion of fact rests. The numerals I, I, III, and IV in the foot-notes in this history refer to the volumes of these translations, and the Arabic numerals following the four Romans designate the numbered paragraphs into which the translations are divided, unless the ‘“‘p.,” indicating ‘‘page,” is inserted between. It is hoped that, by this means of keeping all technical discussion of sources in the four volumes of translated documents, the author has succeeded in unburdening this history of the workshop débris, which would other- wise often encumber it; while at the same time the advantage of close contact with the sources for every fact adduced is not sacrificed.

At the same time in both the northern and southern Asiatic dominions of the Pharaoh, an overflow of Beduin immigration, among which were undoubtedly some of the tribes which later coalesced with the Israelites, aggravated the danger, and together with the persistent advance of the Hittites, finally resulted in the complete dissolution of the Asiatic empire of Egypt, down to the very frontier of the northeastern Delta. Meanwhile the internal disorders had caused the fall of the Highteenth Dynasty, an event which terminated the First Period of the Empire (1350 B. C.). Harmhab, one of the able commanders under the fallen dynasty, survived the crisis and finally seized the throne. Under his vigourous rule the disorganized nation was grad- ually restored to order, and his successors of the Nineteenth Dynasty (1350-1205 B. C.) were able to begin the recovery of the lost empire in Asia. But the Hittites were too firmly entrenched in Syria to yield to the Egyptian onset. The assaults of Seti I, and half a generation of persistent campaigning under Ramses II, failed to push the northern frontier of the Empire far beyond the limits of Palestine. Here it remained and Syria was never permanently recov- ered. Semitic influences now powerfully affected Egypt. Fic. 6.—A TRIPLE SHADUF.

{"context": "Now and then an aggressive and able ruler gained the ascendency for a brief reign, and under one of these the subjugation of Upper Nubia was carried forward to a point above the third cat- aract; but his conquest perished with him. After possibly a century of such internal conflict, the country was entered and appropriated by a line of rulers from Asia, who had seemingly already gained a wide dominion there. These foreign usurpers, now known as the Hyksos, after Manetho’s designation of them, maintained themselves for perhaps a century. Their residence was at Avaris in the eastern Delta, and at least durmg the later part of their supremacy, the Egyptian nobles of the South succeeded in gaining more or less independence. Finally the head of a Theban family boldly proclaimed himself king, and in the course of some years these Theban princes succeeded in expelling the Hyksos from the country, and driving them back from the Asiatic frontier into Syria. It was under the Hyksos and in the struggle with them that the conservatism of millennia was broken up in the Nile valley. The Egyptians learned aggressive war for the first time, and introduced a well organized military system, including chariotry, which the importation of the horse by the Hyksos now enabled them to do. Egypt was trans- formed into a military empire. In the struggle with the Hyksos and with each other, the old feudal families perished, or were absorbed among the partisans of the dominant Theban family, from which the imperial line sprang.

In spite of the wide extent of marshy ground, left stagnating by the inundation, the dry airs of the desert, blowing constantly across the valley, quickly dry the soil, and there is never any malarial infection in Upper Egypt. Even in the vast morass of the Delta, malaria is practically unknown. Thus, lying just outside of the tropics, Egypt enjoyed a mild climate of unsurpassed salubrity, devoid of the harshness of a northern winter, but at the same time sufficiently cool to escape those enervating influences inherent in tropical conditions. The prospect of this contracted valley spread out before the Nile dweller, was in antiquity, as it is to-day, somewhat monotonous. The level Nile bottoms, the gift of the river, clad in rich green, shut in on either hand by the yellow cliffs, are unrelieved by any elevations or by any forests, save the occasional groves of graceful palms, which fringe the river banks or shade the villages of sombre mud huts (Fig. 4), with now and then a sycamore, a tamarisk or an acacia. <A network of irrigation canals traverses the country in every direction like a vast arterial system. The sands of the deso- late wastes which lie behind the cafion walls, drift in athwart the cliffs, and often invade the green fields so that one may stand with one foot in the verdure of the valley, and the other in the desert sand. Thus sharply defined was the Egyptian’s world: a deep and narrow valley of unparalleled fertility, winding between lifeless deserts, furnishing a remarkable environment, not to be found elsewhere in all the world. Such surroundings reacted powerfully upon the mind and thought of the Egyptian, conditioning and deter- mining his idea of the world and his notion of the mysterious powers which ruled it.

Nowhere on earth have the witnesses of a great, but now extinct civilization, been so plentifully preserved as along the banks of the Nile. Even in the Delta, where the storms of war beat more fiercely than in the valley above, and where the slow accumulations from the yearly flood have gradually entombed them, the splendid cities of the Pharaohs have left great stretches, cumbered with enormous blocks of granite, limestone and sandstone, shattered obelisks, and massive pylon bases, to proclaim the wealth and power of forgotten ages; while an ever growing multitude of modern visitors are drawn to the upper valley by the colossal ruins that greet the wondering traveller almost at every bend in the stream.", "question": "What two primary geographical divisions did the ancient Egyptians use to describe their world?", "answer": "The ancient Egyptians viewed their world as primarily composed of the \"Black Land\" (the fertile Nile valley) and the \"Red Land\" (the surrounding reddish desert)."}

A vast and elaborate system of irrigation canals and reservoirs first receives the flood, which is then allowed to escape into the fields as needed. Here it rests long enough to deposit its burden of rich, black earth from the upper reaches of the Blue Nile. At such times the appearance of the country is picturesque in the extreme, the glistening surface of the waters being dotted here and there by the vivid green of the waving palm groves, which mark the villages, now accessible only along the dykes _ belonging to the irrigation system (Fig. 2). Thus year by year, the soil which would otherwise become impoverished in the elements necessary to the production of such prodi- gious harvests, is invariably replenished with fresh resources. As the river sinks below the level of the fields again, it is necessary to raise the water from the canals by artificial means, in order to carry on the constant irrigation of the growing crops in the outlying fields, which are too high to be longer refreshed by absorption from the river (Fig. 6).! Thus a genial and generous, but exacting soil, demanded for its cultivation the development of a high degree of skill *The device used (called a “shadfif”) resembles the well-sweep of our grandfathers. Fig. 6 shows the leathern bucket suspended from one end of the sweep, while at the other end a huge lump of dried mud serves as a counter- poise.

{"context": "Egyptian intercourse from age to age, and reciprocal influences ensue; until in the thirteenth century B. C. the peoples of southern Europe, long discernible in their material civilization, emerge in the written documents of Egypt for the first time in history. It was then that the fortunes of the Pharaohs began to decline, and as the civili- zation and power, first of the East and then of classic Europe, slowly developed, Egypt was finally submerged in the great world of Mediterranean powers, first dominated by Persia, and then by Greece and Rome. The career of the races which peopled the Nile valley falls into a series of more or less clearly marked epochs, each of which is rooted deeply in that which preceded it, and itself contains the germs of that which is to follow. A more or less arbitrary and artificial but convenient sub-division of these epochs, beginning with the historic age, is furnished by the so-called dynasties of Manetho. This native historian 18 14 A HISTORY OF EGYPT of Egypt, a priest of Sebennytos, who flourished under Ptolemy I (305-285 B. C.), wrote a history of his country in the Greek language. The work has perished, and we only know it in an epitome by Julius Africanus and Eusebius, and extracts by Josephus. The value of the work was slight, as it was built up on folk-tales and popular traditions of the early kings. Manetho divided the long succession of Phar- aohs as known to him, into thirty royal houses or dynas- ties, and although we know that many of his divisions are arbitrary, and that there was many a dynastic change where he indicates none, yet his dynasties divide the kings into convenient groups, which have so long been employed in modern study of Egyptian history, that it is now impossible to dispense with them. After an archaic age of primitive civilization, and a period of small and local kingdoms, the various centres of civiliza- tion on the Nile gradually coalesced into two kingdoms: one comprising the valley down to the Delta; and the other made up of the Delta itself. In the Delta, civilization rap- idly advanced, and the calendar year of 365 days was intro- duced in 4241 B. C., the earliest fixed date in the history of the world as known to us.!

He divided the succession of Pharaohs into thirty dynasties, which, despite being arbitrary in some divisions, are still used in modern study of Egyptian history."}

It is more- over a completed product as observable in our earliest pre- served examples of it; but the fusion of the Libyans and 25 26 A HISTORY OF EGYPT east Africans with the Nile valley peoples continued far into historic times, and in the case of the Libyans may be traced in ancient historical documents for three thousand years or more. The Semitic immigration from Asia, examples of which are also observable in the historic age, occurred in an epoch that lies far below our remotest historical horizon. We shall never be able to determine when, nor with cer- tainty through what channels it took place, although the most probable route is that along which we may observe a similar influx from the deserts of Arabia in historic times, the isthmus of Suez, by which the Mohammedan invasion entered the country. While the Semitic language which they brought with them, left its indelible impress upon the old Nile valley people, the nomadic life of the desert which the invaders left behind them, evidently was not so persis- tent, and the religion of Egypt, that element of life which always receives the stamp of its environment, shows no trace of desert life. The affinities observable in the language are confirmed in case of the Libyans, by the surviving products of archaic civilization in the Nile valley, such as some of the early pottery, which closely resembles that still made by the Libyan Kabyles. Again the representations of the early Puntites, or Somali people, on the Egyptian monuments, show striking resemblances to the Egyptians themselves. The examination of the bodies exhumed from archaic burials in the Nile valley, which we had hoped might bring further evidence for the settlement of the problem, has, however, produced such diversity of opinion among the physical anthropologists, as to render it impossible for the historian to obtain decisive results from their researches. The conclu- sion once maintained by some historians, that the Egyptian was of African negro origin, is now refuted; and evidently indicated that at most he may have been slightly tinctured with negro blood, in addition to the other ethnic elements already mentioned.

On the thirtieth anniversary of his appointment by his father as crown-prince to the heirship of the kingdom, the king cele- brated a great jubilee called the ‘‘Feast of Sed,’’ a word meaning ‘‘tail,’’ and perhaps commemorating his assump- tion of the royal lion’s tail at his appointment thirty years before. He was a mighty hunter, and recorded with pride an achievement like the slaying of a hippopotamus. His weapons were costly and elaborate as we shall see. His sev- eral palaces each bore a name, and the royal estate possessed gardens and vineyards, the latter being also named and carefully administered by officials who were responsible for the income therefrom. The furniture of such a palace, even in this remote age was magnificent and of fine artistic quality. Among it were vessels exquisitely wrought in some eighteen or twenty different varieties of stone, especially alabaster (Fig. 14); even in such refractory material as diorite, superb bowls were ground to translucent thinness, and jars of rock crystal were carved with matchless precision to represent natural objects. The pottery, on the other hand, perhaps because of the perfection of the stone vessels, is inferior to that of the predynastic age. The less substantial furniture has for the most part perished, but chests of ebony inlaid with ivory and stools with legs of ivory magnificently carved to represent bull’s legs (Fig. 15), have survived in fragments. Glaze was now more thoroughly mastered than before, and incrustation with glazed plaques and ivory tablets was practiced.

{"context": "The revenue in food and wine from certain of the king’s estates was diverted — and established as permanent income of the tomb to maintain for all time the table supply of the deceased king and of his household and adherents, whose tombs to the number of one or two hundred were grouped about his own. Thus he was surrounded in death by those who had been his companions in life; his women, his body-guard, and even the dwarf, whose dances had diverted his idle hours, all sleep beside their lord that he may continue in the hereafter the state with which he had been environed on earth. Thus early began the elaborate arrangements of the Egyptian upper classes for the proper maintenance of the deceased in the life hereafter. This desire to create a permanent abiding place for the royal dead exerted a powerful influence in the development of the art of building. Already in the First Dynasty we find 42 A HISTORY OF EGYPT a granite floor in one of the royal tombs, that of Usephais, and toward the end of the Second Dynasty the surrounding brick chambers of king Khasekhemui’s tomb enclose a chamber built of hewn limestone, the earliest stone masonry structure known in the history of man (Fig. 25). His pred- ecessor, probably his father, had already built a stone temple which he recorded as a matter of note, and Khasekhemui himself built a temple at Hieraconpolis, of which a granite doorpost has survived. Such works of the skilled artificer and builder (for a number of royal architects were already attached to the court) indicate a well-ordered and highly organized state; but of its character little can be discerned from the scanty materials at our command. The king’s chief assistant and minister in government seems to have been a chancellor, whom we have seen attending him on state occasions. The officials whom we later find as nobles with judicial functions, attached to the two royal residences of the North and South, Pe and Nekhen, already existed under these earliest dynas- ties, indicating an organized administration of judicial and juridical affairs. There was a body of fiscal officials, whose seals we find upon payments of naturalia to the royal tombs, impressed upon the clay jar-sealings; while a fragment of a scribe’s accounts evidently belonging to such an adminis- tration, was found in the Abydos royal tombs.", "question": "What historical innovation in construction resulted from the desire for permanent royal tombs in early Egypt?", "answer": "The desire for permanent royal tombs in early Egypt led to advancements in building art, culminating in the earliest known stone masonry structure, found in King Khasekhemui's tomb by the end of the Second Dynasty."}

Crude statuettes in wood, ivory, or stone, represent the beginnings of that plastic art, which was to achieve such triumphs in the early dynastic age; and three large stone statues of Min, found by Petrie at Coptos, display the rude strength of the predynastic civilization of which we are now speak- ing. The art of the prolific potter was obliged to give way slowly to the artificer in stone, who finally produced excel- lent stone vessels, which he gradually improved toward the end of predynastic period, when his bowls and jars in the hardest stones, like the diorites and porphyries, display mag- nificent work. The most cunningly wrought flints that have ever been found among any people belong to this age. The makers were ultimately able to affix carved ivory hafts, and with equal skill they put together stone and flint axes, flint- headed fish-spears and the like. The war mace with pear- shaped head, as found also in Babylonia, is characteristic of the age.

{"context": "While they thus early possessed all the rudiments of material culture, the people of this age developed a system of writing also. The computations necessary for the dis- covery and use of the calendar show a use of writing in the last centuries of the fifth millennium B. C. It is shown also by the fact that nearly a thousand years later the scribes of the Fifth Dynasty were able to copy a long list of the kings of the North, and perhaps those of the South also (Fig. 29) ; while the mortuary texts to which we have referred will not have survived a thousand years without having been com- mitted to writing in the same way. The hieroglyphs for the Northern Kingdom, for its king, and for its treasury can not have arisen at one stroke with the first king of the dynastic age; but must have been in use long before the rise of the First Dynasty; while the presence of a cursive linear hand at the beginning of the dynasties is conclusive evidence that the system was not then a recent innovation. Of the deeds of these remote kings of the North and South, who passed away before three thousand four hundred B. C. we know nothing. Their tombs have never been discovered, a fact which accounts for the lack of any written monuments 36 A HISTORY OF EGYPT among the contemporary documents, all of which come from tombs of the poorer classes, such as contain no writing even in the dynastic age.

Such a system of government and administration as this of course could not operate without a method of writing, which we find in use both in elaborate hieroglyphics (Fig. 27) and in the rapid cursive hand of the accounting scribe. It already pos- sessed not only phonetic signs representing a whole syllable or group of consonants but also the alphabetic signs, each of which stood for one consonant; true alphabetic letters having thus been discovered in Kgypt two thousand five hundred years before their use by any other people. Had the Egyptian been less a creature of habit, he might have discarded his syllabic signs 3,500 years before Christ, and have written with an alphabet of twenty four letters. In the documents of these early dynasties the writing is in such an archaic form that many of the scanty fragments which we possess from this age are as yet unintelligible to us. Yet it was the medium of recording medical and religious texts, to which in later times a peculiar sanctity and effect- iveness were attributed. The chief events of each year were also recorded in a few lines under its name, and a series of annals covering every year of a king’s reign and showing to a day how long he reigned, was thus produced. <A small fragment only of these annals has escaped destruction, the now famous Palermo Stone,' so called because it is at present in the museum of Palermo (Fig. 29).?

He was a mighty hunter, and recorded with pride an achievement like the slaying of a hippopotamus. His weapons were costly and elaborate as we shall see.

Public works, like the opening of irrigation canals (Fig. 18) or the wall of Menes above Memphis, show their solicitude for the eco- nomic resources of the kingdom, as well as a skill in engi- neering and a high conception of government such as we can not but greatly admire in an age so remote.

Here there entered, as a salutary influence also the incident of the triumphant vindication of Osiris when accused; for there is a hint of a similar justi- fication for all, which, as we shall yet see, was the most fruit- ful germ in Egyptian religion. The myth of Osiris thus in- troduced an ultimately powerful ethical element, which, while not altogether lacking before, needed the personal factor supplied by the Osiris myth to give it vital force. Thus sev- eral nobles of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties threaten those who in the future would appropriate their tombs, that ‘‘judg- ment shall be had with them for it by the great god’’;? and another says that he never slandered others, for ‘‘I desired that it might be well with me in the great god’s presence.’’?

They were engraved upon the passages of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasty pyramids, where they have been preserved in large numbers, and it is largely from them that the above sketch of the early Egyptian’s notions of the hereafter has been taken.

It is accompanied by the inscription: ‘‘ First occurrence of smiting the Easterners.’’ This designation of the event as the ‘‘first occurrence’’ would indicate that it was a customary thing for the kings of the time to chastise these barbarians, and that therefore he was expecting a ‘‘second occurrence,’’ as a matter of course. A ‘‘smiting of the Troglodytes,’’ the same people, recorded on the Pa- lermo Stone? in the First Dynasty, doubtless falls in the reign of king Miebis.

EARLY RELIGION 63 “‘Great Seer’’; while he of Ptah at Memphis was called ‘‘Great Chief of Artificers.’’ Both positions demanded two incumbents at once and were usually held by men of high rank. The incumbents of the other high priesthoods of later origin all bore the simple title of ‘‘overseer or chief of priests.’’ It was the duty of this man not merely to conduct the service and ritual of the sanctuary, but also to administer its endowment of lands, from the income of which it lived, while in time of war he might even command the temple contingent. He was assisted by a body of priests, whose sacerdotal service was with few exceptions merely incidental to their worldly occupations. They were laymen, who from time to time served for a stated period in the temple; thus in spite of the fiction of the Pharaoh as the sole worshipper of the god, the laymen were represented in its service. In the same way the women of the time were commonly priestesses of Neit or Hathor; their service con- sisted in nothing more than dancing and jingling a sistrum before the god on festive occasions. The state fiction had therefore not quite suppressed the participation of the indi- vidual in the service of the temple. In harmony with the conception of the temple as the god’s dwelling the most fre- quent title of the priest was ‘‘servant of the god.”’ Parallel with this development of a state religion, with its elaborate equipment of temple, endowment, priesthood and ritual, the evolution of the provision for the dead had kept even pace. In no land, ancient or modern, has there ever been such attention to the equipment of the dead for their eternal sojourn in the hereafter. The beliefs which finally led the Egyptian to the devotion of so much of his wealth and time, his skill and energy to the erection and equipment of the ‘‘eternal house’’ are the oldest conceptions of a real life hereafter of which we know. He believed that the body was animated by a vital force, which he pictured as a coun- terpart of the body, which came into the world with it, passed through life in its company, and accompanied it into the next world.

He was the patron of the artisan, the artificer and artist, and his High Priest was always the chief artist of the court. Such were the chief gods of Egypt, although many another important deity pre- sided in this or that temple, whom it would be impossible for us to notice here, even with a word. The external manifestations and the symbols with which the Egyptian clothed these gods are of the simplest char- acter and they show the primitive simplicity of the age in which these deities arose. They bear a staff like a Beduin native of to-day, or the goddesses wield a reed-stem; their diadems are of woven reeds or a pair of ostrich feathers, or the horns of a sheep. In such an age, the people frequently saw the manifestations of their gods in the numerous ani- mals with which they were surrounded, and the veneration of these sacred beasts survived into an age of high civiliza- tion, when we should have expected it to disappear. But the animal-worship, which we usually associate with ancient Egypt, as a cult, is a late product, brought forward in the decline of the nation at the close of its history. In the periods with which we shall have to deal, it was unknown; the hawk, for example, was the sacred animal of the sun-god, and as such a living hawk might have a place in the temple, where he was fed and kindly treated, as any such pet might be; but he was not worshipped, nor wag he the object of an elaborate ritual as later.* * Erman, Handbuch, p. 25.

This subterranean stream was connected with the Nile at the first cataract, and thence issued from two caverns, the waters of their life-giving river. It will be seen that for the people among whom this myth arose, the world ended at the first cataract; all that they knew beyond was a vast sea. This was also connected with the Nile in the south, and the river returned to it in the north, for this sea, which they called the ‘‘Great Circle’! sur- rounded their earth. It is the idea inherited by the Greeks, who called the sea Okeanos, or Ocean. In the beginning only this ocean existed, upon which there then appeared an egg, or as some said a flower, out of which issued the sun-god. From himself he begat four children, Shu and Tefnut, Keb and Nut. All these, with their father, lay upon the ocean of chaos, when Shu and Tefnut, who repre- sent the atmosphere, thrust themselves between Keb and Nut. They planted their feet upon Keb and raised Nut on high, so that Keb became the earth and Nut the heavens. Keb and Nut were the father and mother of the four divin- ities, Osiris and Isis, Set and Nephthys; together they formed with their primeval father the sun-god, a circle of nine deities, the ‘‘ennead’’ of which each temple later pos- sessed a local form. This correlation of the primitive divin- ities as father, mother and son, strongly influenced the theology of later times until each temple possessed an arti- ficially created triad, of purely secondary origin, upon which an ‘‘ennead’’ was then built up. Other local versions of this story of the world’s origin also circulated. One of them represents Re as ruling the earth for a time as king over men, who plotted against him, so that he sent a god- dess, Hathor, to slay them, but finally repented and by a ruse succeeded in diverting the goddess from the total exter- mination of the human race, after she had destroyed them in part.

Isis later gave birth to a son, Horus, whom she secretly reared among the marshy fastnesses of the Delta as the avenger of his father. Grown to manhood, the youth pursued Set and in the ensuing awful battle, which raged from end to end of the land, both were fear- fully mutilated. But Set was defeated, and Horus tri- umphantly assumed the earthly throne of his father. There- upon Set entered the tribunal of the gods, and charged that the birth of Horus was not without stain, and that his claim to the throne was not valid. Defended by Thoth, the god of letters, Horus was vindicated and declared ‘‘true in speech,’’ or ‘‘triumphant.’’ According to another version it was Osiris himself who was thus vindicated. Not all the gods who appear in these tales and fancies became more than mythological figures.

Its fancies explain for him the world about him, its fears are his hourly master, its hopes his con- stant Mentor, its feasts are his calendar, and its outward usages are to a large extent the education and the motive toward the gradual evolution of art, literature and science. As among all other early peoples, it was in his surroundings that the Egyptian saw his gods. The trees and springs, the stones and hill-tops, the birds and beasts were creatures like himself, or possessed of strange and uncanny powers of which he was not master. Among this host of spirits ani- mating everything around him, some were his friends, ready to be propitiated and to lend him their aid and protection; while others with craft and cunning lowered about his path- way, awaiting an opportunity to strike him with disease and pestilence, and there was no misfortune in the course of nature but found explanation in his mind as coming from one of these evil beings about him. Such spirits as these were local, each known only to the dwellers in a given locality, and the efforts to serve and propitiate them were of the humblest and most primitive character. Of such worship we know little or nothing in the Old Kingdom, but during the Empire we shall be able to gain fleeting glimpses into this naive and long forgotten world. But the Egyptian peo- pled not merely the local circle about him with such spirits; the sky above him and earth beneath his feet were equally before him for explanation. Long ages of confinement to his elongated valley, with its monotonous, even if sometimes 53 54 A HISTORY OF EGYPT grand scenery, had imposed a limited range upon his imagi- nation; neither had he the qualities of mind which could be stirred by the world of nature to such exquisite fancies as those with which the natural beauties of Hellas inspired © the imagination of the Greeks. In the remote ages of that earliest civilization, which we have briefly surveyed in the preceding chapter, the shepherds and plowmen of the Nile valley saw in the heavens a vast cow, which stood athwart the vault, with head in the west, the earth lying between fore and hind feet, while the belly of the animal, studded with stars, was the arch of heaven.", "question": "What was the historical cosmological belief of the early Egyptians regarding the heavens?", "answer": "In the remote ages of earliest civilization, the shepherds and plowmen of the Nile valley historically conceived of the heavens as a vast cow, with its head in the west, its belly studded with stars, and the earth lying between its fore and hind feet."}

EARLY RELIGION 63 “‘Great Seer’’; while he of Ptah at Memphis was called ‘‘Great Chief of Artificers.’’ Both positions demanded two incumbents at once and were usually held by men of high rank. The incumbents of the other high priesthoods of later origin all bore the simple title of ‘‘overseer or chief of priests.’’ It was the duty of this man not merely to conduct the service and ritual of the sanctuary, but also to administer its endowment of lands, from the income of which it lived, while in time of war he might even command the temple contingent. He was assisted by a body of priests, whose sacerdotal service was with few exceptions merely incidental to their worldly occupations. They were laymen, who from time to time served for a stated period in the temple; thus in spite of the fiction of the Pharaoh as the sole worshipper of the god, the laymen were represented in its service. In the same way the women of the time were commonly priestesses of Neit or Hathor; their service con- sisted in nothing more than dancing and jingling a sistrum before the god on festive occasions. The state fiction had therefore not quite suppressed the participation of the indi- vidual in the service of the temple. In harmony with the conception of the temple as the god’s dwelling the most fre- quent title of the priest was ‘‘servant of the god.”’ Parallel with this development of a state religion, with its elaborate equipment of temple, endowment, priesthood and ritual, the evolution of the provision for the dead had kept even pace. In no land, ancient or modern, has there ever been such attention to the equipment of the dead for their eternal sojourn in the hereafter. The beliefs which finally led the Egyptian to the devotion of so much of his wealth and time, his skill and energy to the erection and equipment of the ‘‘eternal house’’ are the oldest conceptions of a real life hereafter of which we know. He believed that the body was animated by a vital force, which he pictured as a coun- terpart of the body, which came into the world with it, passed through life in its company, and accompanied it into the next world. This he called a ‘‘ka,’’ and it is often 64 A HISTORY OF", "question": "What was the historical ancient Egyptian belief concerning the 'ka' and its connection to the afterlife, and how did this influence burial practices?", "answer": "The ancient Egyptians believed the body was animated by a 'ka,' a vital force that was a counterpart of the body, born with it, accompanied it through life, and continued with it into the next world.

From dynasty to dynasty, or sometimes from reign to reign, it followed the pyramid, the light construc- tion of the palaces and villas not interfering seriously with such mobility. After the Third Dynasty the residence was always in the vicinity of later Memphis. The palace itself was double, or at least it possessed two gates in its front, corresponding to the two ancient kingdoms, of which it was now the seat of government. Each door or gate had a name indicating to which kingdom it belonged; thus Snefru named the two gates of his palace ‘‘Exalted is the White Crown of Snefru upon the Southern Gate,’’ and ‘‘ Exalted is the Red Crown of Snefru upon the Northern Gate.’” Throughout Egyptian history the facade of the palace was called the ‘‘double front,’’ and in writing the word ‘‘palace”’ the scribe frequently placed the sign of two houses after it. The royal office was also termed the ‘‘double cabinet,’’ although it is not likely that there were two such bureaus, one for the South and one for the North; the division prob- ably went no further than the purely external symbolism of the two palace gates. The same was doubtless true of the 1 Ibid. 27, 148. THE OLD KINGDOM 79 central administration as a whole. We thus hear of a ‘‘double granary’’ and a ‘‘double white house’’ as depart- ments of the treasury. These doubtless no longer corre- sponded to existing double organizations; they have become a fiction surviving from the first two dynasties; but such double names were always retained in the later terminology of the government.

Even the palace of the king, though of course fortified, was of this light construction; hence the cities of ancient Egypt have disappeared entirely or left but mounds containing a few scanty fragments of ruined walls. Beds, chairs, stools and chests of ebony, inlaid with ivory in the finest workman- ship, formed the chief articles of furniture. Little or no use was made of tables, but the rich vessels of alabaster, and other costly stones, of copper, or sometimes of gold and silver, were placed upon bases and standards which raised them from the floor. The floors were covered with heavy rugs, upon which guests, especially ladies, frequently sat, in preference to the chairs and stools.

The courtier might desig- nate him impersonally as ‘‘one,’’ and ‘‘to let one know”’ becomes the official phrase for ‘‘report to the king.’’ His government and ultimately the monarch personally were called the ‘‘Great House,’’ in Egyptian Per-o, a term which has descended to us through the Hebrews as ‘‘Pharaoh.’’ There was also a number of other circumlocutions, which the fastidious courtier might employ in referring to his divine lord. When he died he was received into the circle of the gods, to be worshipped like them ever after in the temple before the vast pyramid in which he slept. Court customs had gradually developed into an elaborate official etiquette, for the punctilious observance of which, already in this distant age, a host of gorgeous marshals and court chamberlains were in constant attendance at the palace. There had thus grown up a palace life, not unlike that of 74 THE OLD KINGDOM ty modern times in the East, a life into which we gain obscure glimpses in the numerous titles borne by the court lords of the time. With ostentatious pride they arrayed these titles on the walls of their tombs, mingled with sounding predi- cates indicating their high duties and exalted privileges in the circle surrounding the king. There were many ranks, and the privileges of each, with all possible niceties of pre- cedence, were strictly observed and enforced by the court marshals at all state levees and royal audiences. Every need of the royal person was represented by some palace lord, whose duty it was to supply it, and who bore a corre- sponding title, like the court physician or the leader of the court music. Although the royal toilet was comparatively simple, yet a small army of wig-makers, sandal-makers, per- fumers, launderers, bleachers and guardians of the royal wardrobe, filled the king’s chambers. They record their titles upon their tomb-stones with visible satisfaction. Thus to take an example at random, one of them calls himself ‘‘Overseer of the cosmetic box . . . doing in the matter of cosmetic art to the satisfaction of his lord; overseer of the cosmetic pencil, sandal-bearer of the king, doing in the matter of the king’s sandals to the satisfaction of his lord.’’!", "question": "What was the historical perception and official designation of the king in the Old Kingdom of Egypt?", "answer": "In the Old Kingdom, the king was officially a god, often referred to as the \"Good God.\" His government, and ultimately the monarch personally, was called the \"Great House,\" or \"Per-o,\" which has descended to us as \"Pharaoh.\""}

In the Third Dynasty, at least, the Pharaoh was not satisfied with one tomb, but in his double capacity as king of the Two Lands he erected two, just as the palace was double for the same reason. We find the monarch’s tomb now far surpassing that of the noble in its extent and magnificence. The mortuary service of the Pharaoh’s lords might be conducted in the chapel in the east side of the mastaba; but that of the Pharaoh himself required a separate building, a splendid mortuary temple on the east side of the pyramid.

The king’s favourite wife became the official queen, whose eldest son usually received the appointment as crown prince to succeed his father. But as at all oriental courts, there was also a royal harem with numerous inmates. Many sons usually surrounded the monarch, and the vast revenues of the palace were liberally distributed among them. A son of king Khafre in the Fourth Dynasty left an estate of fourteen towns, besides a town house and two estates at the royal residence, the pyramid city.

At the head of government there was theoretically none to question the Pharaoh’s power.

This cursive business hand, which we call ‘‘hier- atic,’’ had already begun under the earliest dynasties, and by the rise of the Old Kingdom, it had developed into a graceful and rapid system of writing, which showed no nearer resemblance to the hieroglyphic than does our own hand-writing to our print. The introduction of this system into the administration of government and the transaction of every day business, produced profound changes in gov- ernment and society, and created for all time the class dis- tinction between the illiterate and the learned, which is still a problem of modern society. It was the acquirement of this method of writing which enabled the lad to enter upon the coveted official career as a scribe or overseer of a maga- zine, or steward of an estate. Hence the master put before the boy model-letters, proverbs, and literary compositions, which he labouriously copied into his roll, the copy-book of this ancient school-boy. A large quantity of these copy- books from the Empire, some fifteen hundred years after the fall of the Old Kingdom, has been found; and many a com- position which would otherwise have been lost, has thus sur- vived, in the uncertain hand of a pupil in the scribal schools. * Pap.

In relief, now greatly in demand for temple decoration, and the chapel of the mastaba-tomb, the Egyptian was con- fronted by the problem of foreshortening and perspective. He must put objects having roundness and thickness, upon a flat surface. How this should be done had been deter- mined for him before the beginning of the Old Kingdom. A conventional style had already been established before the third dynasty, and that style was now sacred and inviolable tradition. While a certain freedom of development sur- vived, that style in its fundamentals persisted throughout the history of Egyptian art, even after the artist had learned to perceive its shortcomings.

The unknown mas- ter, who must take his place among the world’s great sculp- tors, while contending with technical difficulties which no modern sculptor attempts, has here given a real king imper- ishable form, and shown us with incomparable skill the divine and impassive calm with which the men of the time had endued their sovereign. In softer material, the sculptor gained a freer hand, of which one of the best examples is the sitting figure of Hemset in the Louvre (Fig. 50). It is surprisingly vivacious, in spite of the summarization of the body, an insufficiency which is characteristic of all Old King- dom sculpture in the round. It is the head which appeals to the artist as the most individual element in his model, and on the head therefore he exhausts all his skill. These forms of kings and nobles show little variety in attitude; indeed there is but one other posture in which a person of rank could be depicted. Perhaps the best example of it is the figure of the priest Ranofer, a speaking likeness of the proud noble of the time (Fig. 49).

The latter, after he had offered some examples of his remarkable powers, reluctantly told the king in response to questions, that the three children soon to be born by the wife of a cer- tain priest of Re were begotten of Re himself, and that they should all become kings of Egypt. Seeing the king’s sadness at this information the wise man assured him that there was no reason for his melancholy, saying, ‘‘Thy son, his son, and then one of them,’’ meaning ‘‘Thy son shall reign; then thy grandson, and after that one of these three children.’’ The conclusion of the tale is lost, but it undoubtedly went on to tell how the three children finally became Pharaohs, for it narrates with many picturesque details and remarkable prodigies how the children were born wearing all the insignia of royalty. The names given these children by the disguised divinities who assisted at their birth were: Userkaf, Sahure and Kakai, the names of the first three kings of the Fifth Dynasty. Although the popular tradition knew of only two kings of the Fourth Dynasty after Khufu, having never heard of Dedefre, Shepseskaf and others whose reigns had left no great pyramids, it nevertheless preserved the essen- tial contention of the priests of Re and in kernel! at least the real origin of the Fifth Dynasty. In this folk-tale we have the popular form of what is now the state fiction: every Pharaoh is the bodily son of the sun-god, a belief which was thereafter maintained throughout the history of Egypt!

But the endowment estab- lished by the Fourth Dynasty was respected. While Userkaf, as the founder of the new dynasty, may have had enough to do to make secure the succession of his line, he has left his name’ on the rocks at the first cataract, the earliest of the long series of rock-inscriptions there, which from now on will furnish us many hints of the career of the Pharaohs in the south.

From this region, which like the whole east, he termed the ‘‘God’s-Land,’’ he obtained the fragrant gums and resins so much desired for the incense and ointments indispensable in the life of the oriental.

How strong and effective must have been the organization of Khufu’s government we appreciate in some measure when we learn that his pyramid contains some two million three hundred thousand blocks, each weigh- ing on the average two and a half tons.1_ The mere organiza- tion of labour involved in the quarrying, transportation and proper assembly of this vast mass of material is a task which in itself must have severely taxed the public offices. Herod- otus relates a tradition current in his time that the pyramid had demanded the labour of a hundred thousand men during twenty years, and Petrie has shown that these numbers are quite credible. The maintenance of this city of a hundred ' thousand labourers, who were non-producing and a constant burden on the state, the adjustment of the labour in the quar- ries so as to ensure an uninterrupted accession of material around the base of the pyramid, will have entailed the devel- opment of a small state in itself. The blocks were taken out of the quarries on the east side of the river south of Cairo, and at high water, when the flats were flooded, they were floated across the valley to the base of the pyramid hill. Here an enormous stone ramp or causeway had been erected, a labour of ten years if we may believe Herodotus, and up this incline the stones were dragged to the plateau on which the pyramid stands.

It is uncertain whether his successor, Khafre, was his son or not. But the new king’s name, which means ‘‘ His Shin- ing is Re,’’ like that of Dedefre, would indicate the political influence of the priests of Re at Heliopolis. He built a pyramid (Figs. 68, 70) beside that of Khufu, but it is some- what smaller and distinctly inferior in workmanship. It was given a sumptuous appearance by making the lowermost section of casing of granite from the first cataract. Scanty remains of the pyramid-temple on the east side are still in place, from which the usual causeway leads down to the margin of the plateau and terminates in a splendid granite building (Fig. 69), which served as the gateway to the cause- way and the pyramid enclosure above. Its interior surfaces are all of polished red granite and translucent alabaster. In a well in one hall of the building seven statues of Khafre were found by Mariette. We have had occasion to examine the best of these in the preceding chapter.1.

{"context": "Notwithstanding thorough-going changes, the new dynasty continued the official cult maintained by their predeces- sors. Re remained supreme and the old foundations were respected. In spite of the independence of the new nobles, it is evident that Pepi I possessedthe necessary force to hold them well in hand. His monuments, large and small, are found throughout Egypt. Now began also the biographies of the officials of the time, affording us a picture of the busy life of the self-satisfied magnates of that distant age; while to these we may fortunately add also their records at the mines and in the quarries. Loyalty now demands no more than a relief showing the king as he worships his gods or smites his enemies; and this done the vanity of the commander of the expedition and his fellows may be gratified in a record of their deeds or adventures, which becomes longer and longer as time passes. Pepi I sent his chief architect and the two ‘‘treasurers of the God,’’ besides the master builder of his pyramid, and a body of artisans, to the quarries at Hammamat to procure the necessary fine stone for his pyra- mid, and they left in the quarry, besides two royal reliefs, three other inscriptions, giving a full list of their names and titles.. At the alabaster quarry of Hatnub the governor of the South, who was also ‘‘great lord of the Hare-nome,’’ recorded his execution of a commission there for Pepi I;? while a military commander perpetuates his achievement of a similar commission for the same king in the Wadi 1], 295-301. 21, 304-5. 134 A HISTORY OF EGYPT Maghara in Sinai.’ The pride of office among the official class is undiminished.

We have a very interesting and instructive example of this official class under the new regime, in Uni, a faithful adherent of the royal house, who has fortunately left us his biography.

The Great Sphinx is there- fore the portrait of a Pharaoh, and an obscure reference to Khafre in an inscription between its forepaws dated fourteen hundred years later in the reign of Thutmose IV,? perhaps shows that in those times he was considered to have had something to do with it. Beyond these buildings we know nothing of Khafre’s deeds, but these show clearly that the great state which Khufu had done so much to create was still firmly controlled by the Pharaoh. 1 Fig. 48 and p. 103. 27, 815. THE PYRAMID BUILDERS 121 Under Khafre’s successor, Menkure, however, if the size of the royal pyramid is an adequate basis for judgment, the power of the royal house was no longer so absolute. Moreover, the vast pyramids which his two predecessors had erected may have so depleted the resources of the state that Menkure was not able to extort more from an exhausted nation. The third pyramid of Gizeh which we owe to him, is less than half as high as those of Khufu and Khafre; its ruined temple recently excavated by Reisner, unfinished at his death, was faced with sun-dried brick, instead of sumptuous granite, by his successor. Of his immediate successors, we possess contemporary monuments only from the reign of Shepse- skaf. Although we have a record that he selected the site for his pyramid in his first year,! he was unable to erect a monument sufficiently large and durable to survive, and we do not even know where it was located; while of the achieve- ments of this whole group of kings at the close of the Fourth Dynasty, including several interlopers, who may now have assumed the throne for a brief time, we know nothing whatever. The century and a half during which the Fourth Dynasty maintained its power was a period of unprecedented splen- dour in the history of the Nile valley people, and as we have seen, the monuments of the time were on a scale of grandeur which was never later eclipsed. It reached its climacteric point in Khufu, and after probably a slight decline in the reign of Khafre, Menkure was no longer able to command the closely centralized power which the family had so success- fully maintained up to that time.", "question": "How is the Fourth Dynasty characterized in the history of the Nile valley, particularly concerning its monuments and royal power?", "answer": "The Fourth Dynasty was a period of unprecedented splendor in the history of the Nile valley people, reaching its peak with Khufu, and known for monumental structures on a grand scale that were never eclipsed."}

The pyramid is or was about four hundred and eighty one feet high, and its square base measured some seven hundred and fifty five feet on a side, but the average error is ‘‘less than a ten thousandth of the side in equality, in squareness and in level’’;! although a rise of ground on the site of the monu- ment prevented direct measurements from corner to corner. Some of the masonry finish is so fine that blocks weighing tons are set together with seams of considerable length, show- ing a joint of one ten thousandth of an inch, and involving edges and surfaces ‘‘equal to optician’s work of the present day, but on a scale of acres instead of feet or yards of mate- rial.’’2 The entire monument is of limestone, except the main sepulchral chamber and the construction chambers above it, where the workmanship distinctly deteriorates. The latter part, that is the upper portion, was evidently built with greater haste than the lower sections. The passages were skilfully closed at successive places by plug-blocks and porteullisses of granite; while the exterior, clothed with an exquisitely fitted casing of limestone (Fig. 66), which has since been quarried away, nowhere betrayed the place of entrance, located in the eighteenth course of masonry above the base near the centre of the north face. It must have been a courageous monarch who from the beginning planned this the greatest mass of masonry ever put together by human hands, and there are evidences in the pyramid of at least two changes of plan. Like all the pyramidoid monu- ments which precede it, it was therefore probably projected on a smaller scale, but before the work had proceeded too far to prevent, by complication of the interior passages, the plan was enlarged to the present enormous base, covering an area of thirteen acres.

{"context": "Men- tuhotep V ruled at least eight years.” After this succession of five Mentuhoteps, we find that the Eleventh Dynasty was then displaced by a new and vigourous Theban family with an Amenemhet at its head. We have already seen one powerful Amenemhet at Thebes as the vizier of Mentuhotep III. This new Amenemhet was able to supplant the last son of the Hleventh Dynasty, and assume the throne as first king of the Twelfth Dynasty. It is very probable also that the new king had royal blood in his veins; in any case his family always regarded the nomarch Intef as their ancestor; they paid him honour and placed his statue in the Karnak temple of Thebes. After a rule of a little over one hundred and sixty years* the Eleventh Dynasty was thus brought to a close about 2000 B. C. They left few monuments; their modest pyramids of sun-dried brick on the western plain of Thebes were in a perfect state of preservation a thousand years later,’ but they barely survived into modern times and their vanish- ing remains were excavated by Mariette. Nevertheless they laid the foundations of Theban power and prepared the way for the vigourous development which now followed under their successors. It was not without hostilities that Amenemhet gained his ex- alted station. We hear of a campaign on the Nile with a fleet of twenty ships of cedar,* followed by the expulsion of some unknown enemy from Egypt. Victorious in these conflicts, Amenemhet was confronted by a situation of the greatest difficulty. Everywhere the local nobles, the nomarchs whose gradual rise we witnessed in the Old Kingdom, were now ruling their great domains like independent sovereigns. They looked back upon a long line of ancestry reaching into the generations of their fathers, whose power had caused the fall of the Old Kingdom; and we find them repairing ‘T, 432-433. 31, 418. 21, 419: +f, 418.

{"context": "Meanwhile the fortunes of Thebes have been constantly rising. Intef, the nomarch, had been succeeded (whether immediately or not is uncertain) by another Intef, who was the first of the Thebans to assume royal honours and titles, thus becoming Intef I, the first king of the dynasty. He pressed the Heracleopolitans vigourously, pushed his frontier northward, and captured Abydos and the entire Thinite nome. He made its northern boundary the ‘‘Door of the North,’’? that is, the northern frontier of his kingdom, as Elephantine at the first cataract was the ‘‘ Door of the South.”’ His ‘‘Door of the North’’ was in all probability Tefibi of Siut’s ‘‘fortress of the Port of the South.’’? His long reign of over fifty years ended, he was followed by his son, Intef II, of whom we know little beyond the fact of his succes- sion.? It was now that the accession of a line of Mentuho- teps, probably a collateral branch of the Theban family, established the universal supremacy of Thebes. Mentuho- tep II evidently brought the war with the North to a trium- phant close. He boasted with impunity of his victories over his countrymen and on the walls of his temple at Gebelén he depicted himself striking down Egyptian and foreigner together, while the accompanying inscription designates the scene as the ‘‘binding of the chiefs of the Two Lands, cap- turing the South and Northland, the foreign countries and the two regions [Egypt], the Nine Bows [foreigners], and the T'wo Lands’’ [Egypt].° About the middle of the twenty second century B.

In plastic art they had reached the highest achievement; in architecture their tireless genius had created the column and originated the colonnade; in government they had elaborated an enlightened and highly developed state, with a large body of law; in religion they were already dimly conscious of a judgment in the hereafter, and they were thus the first men whose ethical intuitions made happiness in the future life dependent upon character.

Sebni quickly mustered the troops of his domain, and with a train of a hundred asses marched rapidly southward, pun- ished the tribe to whom Mekhu’s death was presumably due, rescued the body of his father, and loading it upon an ass, returned to the frontier. He had before dispatched a mes- senger to inform the Pharaoh of the facts, sending a tusk of ivory five feet long, and adding that the best one in his cargo was ten feet long. On reaching the cataract he found that this messenger had returned, bearing a gracious letter from the Pharaoh, who had also sent a whole company of royal em- balmers, undertakers, mourners and mortuary priests, with a liberal supply of fine linen, spices, oils and rich perfumes, that they might immediately embalm the body of the de- ceased noble and proceed to the interment. Sebni then went to Memphis to pay his respects to the Pharaoh and deliver the rich cargo which his father had collected in the south. He was shown every mark of royal favour for his pious deed in rescuing his father’s body. Splendidgifts and the ‘‘gold of praise’’ were showered upon him, and later an official communication from the vizier conveyed to him a parcel of land.’ A loose sovereignty was now extended over the Nubian tribes, and Pepinakht, one of the Elephantine lords, was placed in control with the title ‘‘governor of foreign coun- tries.’’?

The only barrier between them and the south, however, was the cataract region. Mer- nere had now made the first cataract passable for Nile boats at high water, and a closer control, if not the conquest of northern Nubia was quite feasible. It was not of itself a country which the agricultural Egyptian could utilize. The strip of cultivable soil between the Nile and the desert on either hand was in Nubia so scanty, even in places disap- pearing altogether, that its agricultural value was slight. But the high ridges and valleys in the desert on the east con- tained rich veins of gold-bearing quartz, and iron ore’ was plentiful also, although no workings of it have been found there. The country was furthermore the only gateway to the regions of the south, with which constant trade was now maintained. Besides gold, the Sudan sent down the river ostrich feathers, ebony logs, panther skins and ivory; while along the same route, from Punt and the countries further east, came myrrh, fragrant gums and resins and aromatic woods. It was therefore an absolute necessity that the Pharaoh should command this route. We know little of the negro and negroid tribes who inhabited the cataract region at this time.

He accomplished his dangerous errand suc- cessfully, and having punished the Beduin, he returned in safety. In spite of these risks, the communication with Punt was now active and frequent. A subordinate official of the Elephantine family boasts in his lord’s tomb that he accompanied him to Punt no less than probably eleven times and returned in safety.2 It will be seen that the usually accepted seclusion of the Old Kingdom can no longer be maintained. Far from allowing himself to be isolated by the deserts which enveloped his land on east and west, or the cataract which had once formed his southern boundary, the Pharaoh was now maintaining an active and flourishing commerce with the south; while the royal fleets brought cedar from the heights of Lebanon on the north.

I gave to the widow as to her who had a husband; I did not exalt the great above the small in all I gave. Then came great Niles, rich in grain and all things, but I did not collect the arrears of the field.’ After making all due allowance for the natural desire of the nomarch to record the most favourable aspects of his government, it is evident that the paternal character of his local and personal rule, in a community of limited numbers, with which he was ac- quainted by almost daily contact, had proved an untold bless- ing to the country and population at large. The domains over which the nomarch thus ruled were not all his unqualified possessions.His wealth consisted of lands and revenues of two classes: the ‘‘paternal estate,’’ received from his ancestors and entailed in his line; and the ““count’s estate,’’? over which the dead hand had no control; it was conveyed as a fief by the Pharaoh anew at the nomarch’s death. It was this fact which to some extent enabled the Pharaoh to control the feudatories and to secure the appointment of partisans of his house throughout the country. Nevertheless he could not ignore the natural line of succession, which was through the eldest daughter; and as we have observed at Siut, she might even rule the domain after the death of her father until her son was old enough to assume its government.* The magnificent tombs of the lords of the Oryx-nome at Benihasan reveal very clearly the influence of these customs in the fortunes of this family.

In the cemetery at Abydos, among nearly eight hundred men of the time buried there, one in four bore no title either of office or of rank.1 They sometimes designate themselves as ‘‘citi- zens of the town,’ but ordinarily the name stands alone on the tomb-stone, with no hint of the owner’s station. Some of these men were tradesmen, some land-owners, others arti- sans and artificers; but among them were men of wealth and luxury. In the Art Institute at Chicago there is a fine coffin belonging to such an untitled citizen which he had made of costly cedar imported from Lebanon. To such we should undoubtedly add those who occasionally prefix to their names -'Catalogue Cairo, Nos. 20,001-20,780. 2 Ibid. passim.

Of the people bearing titles of office on these Middle Kingdom tomb-stones of Abydos, the vast majority were small office-holders, displaying no title of rank and undoubtedly belongingto this same middle class. The government service now offered a career to the youth of this station in life; the assistant treasurer, who, as the reader will recall, was so solicitous for the maintenance of the Theban nome in time of famine,’ expressly refers to himself as a ‘‘citizen.’’ The inheritance by the son of his father’s calling, already not uncommon in the Old Kingdom, was now general. The tomb-stones of the time exhort the passers-by, as they would that their children should inherit: their offices, to pray for the deceased. Such a custom must necessarily lead to the formation of an official middle class. Their ability to read and write also raised them above those of their own station who were illiterate.

There were also frightful execu- tioners, one of which, a hideous combination of crocodile, lion and hippopotamus, was present at the judgment, and to her the guilty were delivered to be torn in pieces. In harmony with the triumph of the notion of judgment, it is noticeable in the Middle Kingdom that the desire to enjoy at least the reputation of a benevolent and blameless life was more general than before. We now more often read upon the tomb-stones such words as we noticed in the Old Kingdom, ‘‘I gave bread to the hungry, water to the thirsty, clothing to the naked and a ferry-boat to the boatless’’; or ‘‘T was father to the orphan, husband to the widow, and a shelter to the shelterless.’’ We have already referred to the benevolence of the feudal lords of the time. The blessed dead, who successfully sustained the judgment each received the predicate ‘‘true of speech,’’ a term which was interpreted as meaning ‘‘triumphant,’’ and from now on so employed. Every deceased person, when spoken of by the living, received this predicate; it was always written after the names of the dead, and finally also after those of the living in anticipation of their happy destiny. The pre- vailing notions regarding the future life had not been clari- fied by the universal sway of Osiris. On the contrary, all the old beliefs were now intermingled in inextricable con- fusion, only worse confounded by the effort to accommodate them to the Osiris faith, with which in the beginning they had had nothing to do. The favourite idea is still that the departed sojourn in the field of Yaru, enjoying peace and plenty, to which they contribute by cultivating the fruitful plains of the isle, which bring forth grain twelve feet high.

It had its income paying property in all the nomes. Some of this property, as we have ob- served, seems to have been administered by government overseers, while to a large extent it was entrusted to the noble, probably as part of the ‘‘count’s estate.’’ The ‘‘gang- overseers of the crown possessionsof the Oryx-nome’’ gave to Ameni three thousand bulls, of which he rendered an annual account to the Pharaoh, saying, ‘‘I was praised on account of it in the palace [of the Pharaoh]. I carried all their dues to the king’s house; there were no arrears against me in any office of his.’’! Thuthotep, the nomarch of the Hare-nome, depicted with great pride in his tomb at El Bersheh ‘‘great numbers of his cattle from the king and his eattle of the [paternal] estate in the districts of the Hare- nome.’’2 We have no means of even conjecturing the amount or proportion of property held by the crown in the nomes and ‘‘count’s estates,’’ but it is evident that the claims of these powerful feudatories must have seriously curtailed the traditional revenues of the Pharaoh. He no longer had the resources of the country at his unconditional disposal as in the Old Kingdom, even though it was officially only by the king’s grace that his lords held their fiefs. Other resources of the treasury were, however, now available, and if not en- tirely new, were henceforth more energetically exploited. Besides his internal revenues, including the tribute of the nomes and the Residence, the Pharaoh received a regular income from the gold-mines of Nubia, and those on the Coptos road to the Red Sea. The traffic with Punt and the southern coasts of the Red Sea seems to have been the exclu- sive prerogative of the crown, and must have brought in a considerable return; while the mines and quarries of Sinai, and perhaps also the quarries of Hammamat, had also been developed as a regular source of profit.

Nevertheless the great mass of the army employed by the Pharaoh at this time was composed of the free born citizens of the middle class, forming the militia or the permanent force of the nomarch, who at the king’s summons placed himself at their head and led them in the wars of his liege-lord. The army in time of war was therefore made up of contingents fur- nished and commanded by the feudatories. In peace they were also frequently drawn upon to furnish the intelligent power applied to the transportation of great monuments or employed in the execution of public works.

As in the Old Kingdom, war con- tinues to be little more than a series of loosely organized predatory expeditions, the records of which clearly display the still unwarlike character of the Egyptian. The detachment of the nobles from the court since the Sixth Dynasty had resulted in the rise of a provincial so- ciety, of which we gain glimpses especially at Elephantine, Bersheh, Benihasan and Siut, where the tombs of the nom- archs are still preserved, and at Abydos, where all other classes now desired to be buried or to erect a memorial stone. The life of the nobles therefore no longer centred in the court, and the aristocracy of the time, being scattered throughout the country, took on local forms. The nomarch, with his large family circle, his social pleasures, his hunting and his sports, is an interesting and picturesque figure of the country nobleman, with whom we would gladly tarry if space permitted. Characteristic of this age is the promi- nence of the middle class. To some extent this prominence is due to the fact that a tomb, a tomb-stone and mortuary equipment have become a necessity also for a large propor- tion of this class, who felt no such necessity and left no such memorial of their existence in the Old Kingdom.

As we shall see, they had the census and tax records in charge; but their connection with the judicial administration cannot be determined with clearness. Magistrates with the sole title of ‘‘judge,’’ whose tomb-stones are occasionally found, may have been well-to-do middle class citizens who assumed judicial functions within a restricted local jurisdiction. The law which they administered, while it has not survived, had certainly attained a high development, and was capable of the finest distinctions. A nomarch at Siut makes a contract between himself as count, and himself as high priest in the temple of his city, showing the closest differentiation of the rights which he possessed in these two different capacities. The scanty records of the time throw but little light upon the other organs of government, like the administration of lands, the system of irrigation and the like. For the pur- pose of carrying on public works, as well as for taxation and census records, the country was divided into two adminis- trative districts of the South and the North, and the ‘‘ Mag- nates of the Southern Tens’’ served in both districts, showing that they were not confined to the South alone. The office of the governor of the South had disappeared, and already before the close of the Old Kingdom the title had become merely an honourable predicate, if used at all. An elaborate system of registration was in force. Every head of a family was enrolled as soon as he had established an indepen- dent household, with all the members belonging to it, includ- ing serfs and slaves.

Their sister Beket married a powerful official at the court, the vizier and gov- ernor of the residence-city, Nehri, who was nomarch of the neighbouring Hare-nome; and the son of this union, a second Khnumhotep, thereupon by succession through his mother, was appointed to succeed his uncle Nakht as count of Menet- Khufu. Observing the value in the Pharaoh’s eyes of being the son of a nomarch’s daughter, this second Khnumhotep himself married Kheti, the eldest daughter of his neighbour on the north, the nomarch of the Jackal-nome. Thus the eldest son of Khnumhotep the second had a claim through his mother upon the Jackal-nome, to which in due course the Pharaoh appointed him; while the second son of the mar- riage, after honours at court, received his father’s fief of Menet-Khufu.!| The history of this line through four gen- erations thus shows that the Pharaoh could not overlook the claims of the heir of a powerful family, and the deference which he showed them evidently limited the control which he might exert over a less formidable dynasty of nobles. To what extent these lords felt the restraint of the royal hand in their government and administration it is not now possible to determine. A royal commissioner, whose duty it was to look to the interests of the Pharaoh, seems to have resided in the nome, and there were ‘‘overseers of the erown-possessions’’ (probably under him) in charge of the royal herds in each nome;? but the nomarch himself was the medium through whom all revenues from the nome were con- veyed to the treasury. ‘‘ All the imposts of the king’s house passed through my hand,’’ says Ameni of the Oryx-nome. 17, 619 ff. 21, 522.

Ir had been but natural that the kings of the Eleventh Dynasty should reside at Thebes, where the founders of the family had lived during the long war for the conquest of the North. But Amenemhet was evidently unable to con- tinue this tradition. It is easy to imagine reasons why he concluded that his presence was necessary to maintain his position among the Northern nomarchs, who may still have felt leanings toward the fallen house of Heracleopolis. Moreover all the kings of Egypt since the passing of the Thinites a thousand years before had lived there, except the Eleventh Dynasty which he had supplanted. The location which he selected was on the west side of the river some miles south of Memphis. The exact spot cannot now be iden- tified, but it was probably near the place now called Lisht, where the ruined pyramid of Amenemhet has been discov- ered. ‘The name given to the residence city was signifi- eant of its purpose; Amenemhet named it Ithtowe, which means ‘‘Captor of the Two Lands.’’ In hieroglyphic the name is always written enclosed within a square fortress with battlemented walls; from this stronghold Amenemhet swayed the destinies of a state which required all the skill and political sagacity of a line of unusually strong rulers in order to maintain the prestige of the royal house. The nation was made up of an aggregation of small states or petty princedoms, the heads of which owed the Pharaoh their loyalty, but they were not his officials or his servants. Some of these local nobles were ‘‘great lords’’ or nomarchs, - ruling a whole nome; others were only ‘‘counts’’ of a smaller 157 458 A HISTORY OF EGYPT domain with its fortified town.

A new irrigation canal which he made doubtless contributed much to the productivity of his do- mains.‘ Faithful officials of the nomarch show the same solicitude for the welfare of the community over which they were placed; thus an assistant treasurer in the Theban nome residing at Gebelen in the Eleventh Dynasty tells us: ‘‘I sustained Gebelen during unfruitful years, there being four hundred men in distress. But I took not the daughter of a man, I took not his field. I made ten herds of goats, with people in charge of each herd; I made two herds of cattle and a herd of asses. I raised all kinds of small cattle. I made thirty ships, then thirty more ships, and I brought grain for Esneh and Tuphium, after Gebelen was sustained. The nome of Thebes went up stream [to Gebelen for sup- plies]. Never did Gebelen send up-stream or down-stream to another district [for supplies].’?> The nomarch thus devoted himself to the interests of his people, and was con- cerned to leave to posterity a reputation as a merciful and beneficent ruler. All the above records are taken from tomb- inscriptions, records designed to perpetuate such a memory among the people. Still more positive in the same direc- tion is a passage in the biography of Ameni, nomarch of the Oryx-nome, as inscribed in his tomb at Benihasan: ‘‘There 11, 637. 21, 638. 31, 408. ‘J, 407. 61, 459.

Besides this an elaborate equipment (Fig. 81) was placed beside the coffin, including a model boat with all its crew, in order that the deceased might have no difficulty in crossing the waters to the happy isles. By the pyramid of Sesostris III in the sands of the desert there were even buried five large Nile boats (Fig. 82), intended to carry the king and his house across these waters.

It was probably not long after this that Sesostris was dispatched at the head of an army to chastise the Libyans on the western frontier. During the absence of the prince on this campaign in 1970 B. C., Amenemhet died, after a reign of thirty years. Swift messengers were dispatched to inform Sesostris of his father’s demise. Without letting the army know what had happened he quickly left the camp that night and hastened to the Residence at Ithtowe, where he assumed the throne before any pretender among the sons of the harem could forestall him.2 The whole proceeding is characteristic of the history of every royal line from the earliest times in the orient. Similarly, the news of the old king’s death, acciden- tally overheard in the royal tent of Sesostris, threw a certain Sinube, one of the nobles there, into a state of abject terror, 1J, 478-9. 21, 491. 180 A HISTORY OF EGYPT such that he immediately concealed himself, and watching his opportunity fled into Asia, where he remained for many years.

None of these apprehensions existed in the Pyramid Texts, which have since fallen into disuse; but, we repeat, the deceased must now be forewarned and forearmed against all these dangers, and hence a mass of magical formu- laries has arisen since the Old Kingdom by the proper utter- ance of which the dead may overcome all these foes and live in triumph and security.

We have seen that under the vigourous and skilful leader- ship of Amenemhet I the rights and privileges attained by the powerful landed nobles were for the first time properly adjusted and subjected to the centralized authority of the kingship, thus enabling the country, after a long interval, again to enjoy the inestimable advantages accruing from a uniform control of the nation’s affairs. This difficult and delicate task doubtless consumed a large part of Amenemhet I’s reign, but when it was once thoroughly accomplished, his house was able to rule the country for over two centuries. It is probable that at no other time in the history of Egypt did the land enjoy such widespread and bountiful prosperity as now ensued. Amenemhet himself says of it: I was one who cultivated grain and loved the harvest-god ; The Nile greeted me in every valley ; None was hungry in my years, none thirsted then; Men dwelt in peace, through that which I wrought, conversing of me.? In the midst of all this, when Amenemhet fancied that he had firmly established himself and his line upon the throne of the land which owed him so much, a foul conspiracy to assassinate him was conceived among the official members of his household. It would seem that it even went so far as the final attack upon the king’s person in the night, and that he only escaped with his life after a combat with his assailants in his bed-chamber.

The prince brought to his high office a new fund of energy, and as the internal affairs of the country were finally made more and more stable, he was able to devote his attention to the winning of the extreme South, an enterprise which had been interrupted by the rise of the feudal barons and the fall of the Sixth Dynasty.

And when they had got our rulers under their power, they afterward savagely burnt down our cities and demolished the temples of the gods, and used all the inhabitants in a most hostile manner, for they slew some and led the children and wives of others into slavery. At length they made one of themselves king, whose name was Salatis, and he lived at Memphis and made both Upper and Lower Egypt pay tribute, and left garrisons in places that were most suitable for them. And he made the eastern part especially strong, as he foresaw that the Assyrians, who had then the greatest power, would covet their kingdom and invade them. And as he found in the Saite [read Sethroite] nome a city very fit for his purpose (which lay east of the arm of the Nile near Bubastis, and with regard to a certain theological notion was called Avaris), he rebuilt it and made it very strong by the walls he built around it and by a numerous garrison of two hun- dred and forty thousand armed men, whom he put into it to keep it.

Unfortunately the list‘ from which these numbers are taken, recorded in the tomb of the vizier Rekhmire at Thebes, is too mutilated to permit the calculation of the exact total of this tax on all the officials under the jurisdiction of the southern vizer; but- they paid him annually at least some 220,000 grains of gold, nine gold necklaces, over 16,000 grains of silver, some forty chests and other measures of linen, one hundred and six cattle of all ages and some grain; and these figures are short: 1 Gen. 47: 23-27. 21, 679. 3 Ti, 716-745. 10 lvslprayedt THE NEW STATE: SOCIETY AND RELIGION 239 by probably at least twenty per cent. of the real total. As the king presumably received a similar amount from the northern vizier’s collections, this tax on the officials formed a stately sum in the annual revenues. We can unfortu- nately form no estimate of the total of all revenues. Of the royal income from all sources in the Highteenth Dynasty the southern vizier had general charge. The amount of all taxes to be levied and the distribution of the revenue when collected were determined in his office, where a constant bal- ance sheet was kept. In order to control both income and outgo, a monthly fiscal report was made to him by all local officials, and thus the southern vizier was able to furnish the king from month to month with a full statement of pros- pective resources in the royal treasury.!'

The further account of the Hyksos in the same essay shows clearly that the late tradition was at a loss to identify the Hyksos as to nationality and origin. Still quoting from Manetho, Josephus says: ‘‘ All this nation was styled Hyksos, that is, Shepherd Kings; for the first syllable ‘hyk’ in the sacred dialect denotes a king, and ‘sos’ signifies a shepherd, — but this is only according to the vulgar tongue; and of these was compounded the term Hyksos.

Turning to the designations of Asiatic rulers as preserved on the Middle Kingdom and Hyksos monuments, there is no such term to be found as ‘‘ruler of shepherds,’’ and Manetho wisely adds that the word ‘‘sos’’ only means shepherd in the late vulgar dialect. There is no such word known in the older language of the monuments. ‘‘Hyk’’ (Egyptian Hk’), however, is a com- mon word for ruler, as Manetho says, and Khian, one of the Hyksos kings, often gives himself this title upon his monu- ments, followed by a word for ‘‘countries,’’ which by slight and very common phonetic changes might become ‘‘sos’’; so that ‘‘Hyksos’’ is a not improbable Greek spelling for the Egyptian title ‘‘Ruler of Countries.”’ Looking further at the scanty monuments left by the Hyksos themselves, we discover a few vague but nevertheless significant hints as to the character of these strange invaders, whom tradition called Arabians and Pheenicians; and con- temporary monuments designated as ‘‘ Asiatics,’’ ‘‘barbar- ians,’’ and ‘‘rulers of countries.’’ An Apophis, one of their kings, fashioned an altar, now at Cairo, and engraved upon it the dedication: ‘‘He [Apophis] made it as his monument for his father Sutekh, lord of Avaris, when he [Sutekh] 218 A HISTORY OF EGYPT set all lands under his [the king’s] feet.’’!

The great coalition of the kings of Palestine and Syria, with which Thutmose III was called upon to contend at the beginning of his wars, was led and dominated throughout by the powerful king of Kadesh on the Orontes. It required ten years of constant campaign- ing by Thutmose III to achieve the capture of the stubborn city and the subjugation of the kingdom of which it was 1 But see Meyer, Aeg.

The leadership of Kadesh from the beginning to the end of Thutmose III’s campaigns is such as to convey the impression that many Syrian and Palestinian kinglets were its vassals. It is in this Syrian domination of the king of Kadesh that, in the author’s opinion, we should recognize the last nucleus of the Hyksos empire, finally annihilated by the genius of Thutmose III. Hence it was that Thutmose III, the final destroyer of the Hyksos empire, became also the traditional hero who expelled the invaders from Egypt; and as Misphragmouthosis he thus appears in Manetho’s story as the liberator of his country. That it was a Semitic empire we cannot doubt, in view of the Manethonian tra- dition and the subsequent conditions in Syria-Palestine. Moreover the scarabs of a Pharaoh who evidently belonged to the Hyksos time, give his name as Jacob-her or possibly Jacob-El, and it is not impossible that some chief of the Jacob-tribes of Israel for a time gained the leadership in this obscure age. Such an incident would account surpris- ingly well for the entrance of these tribes into Egypt, which on any hypothesis must have taken place at about this age; and in that case the Hebrews in Egypt will have been but a part of the Beduin allies of the Kadesh or Hyksos empire, whose presence there brought into the tradition the partially true belief that the Hyksos were shepherds, and led Manetho to his untenable etymology of the second part of the word.

The deft craftsmen of Egypt soon mastered the art of chariot-making (Fig. 105), while the stables of the Pharaoh contained thousands of the best horses to be had in Asia. In accordance with the spirit of the time, the Pharaoh was accompanied on all public appearances by a body-guardof élite troops and a group of his favourite mili- tary officers. With such force at his back, he ruled in absolute power; there was none to offer a breath of opposition; there was not a whisper of that modern monitor of kings, public opinion, an inconvenience with which rulers in the orient are rarely obliged to reckon, even at the present day. With a man of strong powers on the throne, all were at his feet, but let him betray a single evidence of weakness, and he was quickly made the puppet of court coteries and the victim of harem intrigues as of old. At such a time, as has happened so often since in Egypt, an able minister might overthrow the dynasty and found one of his own. But the man who ex- pelled the Hyksos was thoroughly master of the situation. It is evidently in large measure to him that we owe the recon- struction of the state which was now emerging from the tur- moils of two centuries of internal disorder and foreign invasion. This new state is revealed to us more clearly than that of any other period of Egyptian history under native dynasties, and while we shall recognize many elements surviving from earlier times, we shall be able to discern much that is new ‘in the great structure of government which was now rising under the hands of Ahmose I and his successors. The su- preme position occupied by the Pharaoh meant a very active participation in the affairs of government. He was accus- tomed every morning to meet the vizier, still the main spring of the administration, to consult with him on all the interests of the country and all the current business which necessarily came under his eye.!.

Then I took captive there two women and one hand. One gave to me the gold of bravery besides giving me the captives for slaves.’’? This is the earliest siege of such length known in history, and it is surprising evidence of the stubbornness of the Hyksos defense and the tenacity of king Ahmose in dislodging them from a stronghold in such dan- gerous proximity to the Egyptian frontier. For Sharuhen was probably in southern Judah,” whence the Hyksos might again easily invade the Delta. But Ahmose was not content with driving them out of Sharuhen. We find another mem- ber of the El Kab family, called Ahmose-Pen-Nekhbet, fighting under king Ahmose I in Zahi,? which is Pheenicia and Syria, and it is therefore evident that Ahmose pur- sued the Hyksos northward from Sharuhen, forcing them back to at least a safe distance from the Delta frontier. In the twenty second year of his reign he was still using in his building operations oxen which he had taken from the Asiatics,* so that this or another campaign of his in Asia must have continued to within a few years of that time. Returning to Egypt, now entirely free from all fear of its former lords, he gave his attention to the recovery of the Egyptian possessions in Nubia.

If we ask ourselves regarding the nationality, origin and character of this mysterious Hyksos empire, we can hazard little in reply. Manetho’s tradition that they were Arabians and Pheenicians may well be correct... Such an overflow of southern Semitic emigration into Syria, as we know has since then taken place over and over again, may well have brought together these two elements; and a generation or two of successful warrior-leaders might weld them together into a rude state. We have already seen’ that the Semitic tribes trading with Egypt in the Twelfth Dynasty were pos- sessed of considerably more than the rudiments of civiliza- tion; while the wars of the Pharaohs in Syria immediately after the expulsion of the Hyksos show the presence of civi- lized and highly developed states there. Now, such an em- pire as we believe the Hyksos ruled could hardly have existed without leaving its traces among the peoples of Syria-Palestine for some generations after the beginning of the succeeding Egyptian supremacy in Asia. It would therefore be strange if we could not discern in the records of the subsequent Egyptian wars in Asia some evidence of the surviving wreck of the once great Hyksos empire which the Pharaohs demolished.

The latter dealt with social and political factors no longer new in his time, and manipulated to his own ends the old political units without destroying their iden- tity, whereas Ahmose had now to begin with the erection of a fabric of government out of elements so completely di- vorced from the old forms as to have lost their identity, being now in a state of total flux. The course of events, which culminated in the expulsion of the Hyksos, determined for Ahmose the form which the new state was to assume. He was now at the head of a strong army, effectively organ- ized and welded together by long campaigns and sieges pro- tracted through years, during which he had been both general in the field and head of the state. The character of the gov- ernment followed involuntarily out of these conditions. Egypt became a military state. It was quite natural that it should remain so, in spite of the usually unwarlike char- acter of the Egyptian. The long war with the Hyksos had now educated him as a soldier, the large army of Ahmose had spent years in Asia and had even been for a longer or shorter period among the rich cities of Syria. Having thoroughly learned war and having perceived the enormous wealth to be gained by it in Asia, the whole land was roused and stirred with a lust of conquest, which was not quenched for several centuries.

Amenhotep I, Ahmose’s successor, was therefore obliged to invade Nubia in force and penetrated to the Middle Kingdom frontier at the second cataract,! where the temple of the Sesostrises and Amenemhets had long been in the hands of the barbarians, and was doubtless in ruin. The two Ahmoses of El Kab were with the king, and Ahmose, son of Ebana, reports that ‘‘his majesty captured that Troglodyte of Nubia in the midst of his soldiers.’’2 With the loss of their leader, there was but one outcome for the action; both the Ahmoses captured prisoners, displayed great gallantry and were rewarded by the king.

When he had 11, 131-136, 138-148. 2 Ibid, FEUD OF THE THUTMOSIDS: HATSHEPSUT 269 been ruling for thirteen months he restored the ancient brick temple of his ancestor, Sesostris III, at Semneh, by the second cataract, putting in its place a temple of fine Nubian sandstone, in which he carefully reérected the old boundary stela of the Middle Kingdom’ and reénacted the decree of Sesostris endowing the offerings in the temple with a perma- nent income.

CHAPTER XV THE FEUD OF THE THUTMOSIDS AND THE REIGN OF QUEEN HATSHEPSUT. As Thutmose I approached the thirtieth anniversary of his accession to the heirship of the throne, which was also the thirtieth anniversary of his coronation, he dispatched his faithful architect, Ineni, to the granite quarries of the first cataract to procure two obelisks with which to celebrate the coming Hebsed-festival, or thirty years’ jubilee. In a barge over two hundred feet long and one third as wide Ineni floated the great shafts down the river to Thebes, and erected them before the pylons of the Karnak temple, which he had likewise constructed for the king. He inscribed one of them, which stands to this day before the temple door, with the king’s names and titles,? but before he had begun the inscription upon the other unexpected changes inter- fered, so that it never bore the name of Thutmose I. He was now an old man? and the claim to the throne which he had thus far successfully maintained, was probably weak- ened by the death of his queen, Ahmose, through whom alone he had any valid title to the crown. She was the descendant and representative of the old Theban princes who had fought and expelled the Hyksos, and there was a strong party who regarded the blood of this line as alone entitled to royal honours. She had borne Thutmose I four children, two sons and two daughters; but both sons and one of the daughters had died in youth or childhood. The surviving daughter, Makere-Hatshepsut, was thus the only child of the old line, and so strong was the party of legitimacy, that they had forced the king, years before, at about the middle of his 1TI, 105. 2TI, 86-8. 311, 64, 1. 11. 266 FEUD OF THE THUTMOSIDS: HATSHEPSUT 267 reign, to proclaim her his successor, in spite of the disin- elination general throughout Egyptian history to submit to the rule of aqueen.

In any case, when Thutmose III and his aggressive queen had ruled about five years, Thutmose II, allying himself with the old dethroned king, Thutmose I, succeeded in thrusting aside Thutmose III and Hatshepsut and seizing the crown. Then Thutmose I and II, father and son, began a bitter persecution of the memory of Hatshepsut, cutting out her name on the monuments and placing both their own over it wherever they could find it.

On a feast day, as the image of the god was borne, amid the acclama- tions of the multitude, from the holy place into the court of the temple, the priest, Thutmose III, was stationed with his colleagues in the northern colonnade in Thutmose I’s hall of the temple. The priests bore the god around both sides of the colonnade, as if he were looking for some one, and he finally stopped before the young prince, who prostrated him- self upon the pavement. But the god raised him up, and as an indication of his will, had him placed immediately in the ‘‘Station of the King,’’ which was the ceremonial spot where only the king might stand in the celebration of the temple ritual. Thutmose I, who had but a moment before been burning incense to the god, and presenting him with a great oblation, was thus superseded by the will of the same god, clearly indicated in public.t. Thutmose III’s five-fold name and titulary were immediately published, and on the third of May, in the year 1501, B. C., he suddenly stepped from the duties of an obscure prophet of Amon into the palace of the Pharaohs. Years afterward, on the occasion of inaugurating some of his new halls in the Karnak temple of Amon, he repeated this incident to his assembled court, and added that instead of going to Heliopolis to receive there the acknowledgment of the sun-god as king of Egypt, he was taken up into the heavens where he saw the sun-god in all his most glorious splendour, and was duly crowned and given his royal names by the god himself.

In the north these were subsequently Arameans, while in the south they may be designated as Canaanites. In general these peoples showed little genius for government, and were totally without any motives for consolidation. Divided by the physical conformation of the country, they were organized into numerous city-kingdoms, that is, petty principalities, consisting of a city, with the sur- rounding fields and outlying villages, all under the rule of a local dynast, who lived in the said city. Hach city had not only its own kinglet, but also its own god, a local ba‘al (Baal) or ‘‘lord,’’ with whom was often associated a ba‘lat or ‘‘lady,’’ a goddess like her of Byblos. These miniature kingdoms were embroiled in frequent wars with one another, each dynast endeavouring to unseat his neighbour and absorb the latter’s territory and revenues. Exceeding all the others in size was the kingdom of Kadesh, the surviving nucleus of Hyksos power. It had developed in the only place where the conditions permitted such an expansion, occupying a very advantageous position on the Orontes.

In less than six months, that is, within the limits of the dry season in Pales- tine, he had marched from Tharu, gained a sweeping victory at Megiddo, captured the city after a long and arduous investment, marched to the Lebanon and taken three cities there, built and garrisoned a permanent fort near them, begun reorganizing the government in northern Palestine, and completed the return journey to Thebes.’ With what difficulties such an achievement was beset we may learn by a perusal of Napoleon’s campaign from Egypt through the same country against Akko, which is almost exactlyas far from Kgypt as Megiddo. We may then understand why it was that Thutmose immediately celebrated three ‘‘ Feasts of Victory’’ in his capital. They were each five days long and coincided with the first, second and fifth calendar feasts of Amon. The last was held in Thutmose’s mortuary temple on the western plain of Thebes, which was now completed, and this may have been the first celebration held in it. These feasts were made permanent, endowed with an annual income of plentiful offerings.” At the feast of Opet, which was Amon’s greatest annual feast and lasted eleven days, he presented to the god the three towns which he had cap- tured in southern Lebanon,* besides a rich array of magnifi- cent vessels of gold, silver and costly stones from the prodig- ious spoil of Retenu.* In order to furnish income to main- tain the temple on the sumptuous plan thus projected, he gave Amon not only the said three towns, but also extensive lands in Upper and Lower Egypt, supplied them with plen- tiful herds and with hosts of peasant serfs taken from among his Asiatic prisoners.” Thus was established the foundation of that vast fortune of Amon, which now began to grow out of all proportion to the increased wealth of other temples.

Her king naturally desired to be on good terms with the great empire of the west, and the gifts of costly stone, chiefly lapis- lazuli from Babylon, and the horses which he sent to Thut- mose, so that they reached him while on this campaign, were, of course, interpreted by the Egyptians as tribute.’ In all probability no battles were fought on this expedition. Returning to Thebes as before, in October, the king imme- diately planned for the enlargement of the Karnak temple, to suit the needs of the empire of which he dreamed. Moreover the slowly rising bed of the river had now raised the waters of the inundation until they invaded the temple area, and it had become necessary to elevate the temple pavement. The splendid gate of Amenhotep I was sacrificed to this necessity. By the latter part of February, at the feast of the new moon, which happened by a lucky chance to fall upon the day of the tenth feast of Amon, he was able personally to celebrate the foundation-ceremonies with the greatest splendour.* To render the act especially auspicious the god appeared and even himself participated in the stretching of the measuring cord as the foundation- plan was laid out.t As the west end, the real front of the temple, was marred by Hatshepsut’s obelisks, rising from his father’s dismantled hall, and he was unable or unwilling to build around his father’s obelisks, which stood before the western entrance of the temple, Thutmose", "question": "How did the rising power of Assyria react to Thutmose III's victory, and how was this perceived by the Egyptians?", "answer": "The king of Assyria sent gifts of costly stone and horses to Thutmose III, which the Egyptians interpreted as tribute, indicating Assyria's desire to be on good terms with the growing Egyptian Empire."}

All her chief favourites found place among the scenes. Senmut was even allowed to depict himself on one of the walls praying to Hathor for the queen, an unparalleled honour.’ This unique temple was in its function the culmination of a new development in the arrangement and architecture of the royal tomb and its chapel or temple. Perhaps because they had other uses for their resources, perhaps because they recognized the futility of so vast a tomb, which yet failed to preserve from violation the body of the builder, the Pharaoh, as we have seen, had gradually abandoned the con- struction of a pyramid. With its mortuary chapel on the east front, it had survived probably into the reign of Ahmose I, but it had been gradually declining in size and importance, while the shaft and chambers under it and the chapel before it remained relatively large. Amenhotep I was the last to follow the old traditions; he pierced a passage two hundred feet long into the western cliffs of Thebes, terminating in a mortuary chamber for the reception of the royal body.* Before the cliff, at the entrance to the passage, he built a modest mortuary chapel, surmounted by a pyramidal roof, to which we have already adverted.? Probably for purposes of safety Thutmose I then took the radical step of separating the tomb from the mortuary chapel before it. The latter was still left upon the plain at the foot of the cliffs, but the sepulchre chamber, with the passage leading to it (Figs. 109-10) was hewn into the rocky wall of a wild and desolate valley (Fig. 108), lying behind the western cliffs, some two miles in a direct line from the river, and accessible only by a long detour northward, involving nearly twice that dis- tance. It is evident that the exact spot where the king’s body was entombed was intended to be kept secret, that all possibility of robbing the royal burial might be precluded. 1 See p. 275; II, 246-295. ?

Of this, the queen herself tells us: ‘‘I sat in the palace, I remembered him who fashioned me, my heart led me to make for him two Obelisks of electrum, whose points mingled with heaven.’’? Her inevitable favourite, Senmut, was therefore called in and instructed to proceeed to the granite quarries at the first cataract to secure the two gigantic shafts for the obelisks. He levied the necessary forced labour and began work early in February of the queen’s fifteenth year. By early August, exactly seven months later, he had freed the huge blocks from the quarry,” was able to employ the high water then rapidly approaching to float them, and towed them to Thebes before the inundation had again fallen. The queen then chose an extraordinary location for her obelisks, namely, the very colonnaded hall of the Karnak temple erected by her father, where her husband Thutmose III had been named king by oracle of Amon; although this necessitated the removal of all her father’s cedar columns in the south half of the hall and four of those in the north half, besides, of course, unroofing the hall, and demolishing the south wall, where the obelisks were introduced. They were richly over- laid with electrum, the work on which was done for the queen by Thutiy.2 She avers that she measured out the precious metal by the peck, like sacks of grain,* and she is supported in this extraordinary statement by Thutiy, who states that by royal command he piled up in the festival hall of the palace no less than nearly twelve bushels of electrum.> The queen boasts of their beauty, ‘‘their summits being of elec- trum of the best of every country, which are seen on both sides of the river.

The greatest hall is nearly one hundred and forty feet long, and lies transversely across the axis of the temple. This hall was called ‘‘Menkheperre [Thutmose IIT] is Glorious in Monuments,’’ a name which it still bore six hundred and fifty years later.

The statues of his fathers, while many have perished, have recently been discovered in a court south of the temple, where they had been concealed for safety in time of war. The third campaign, of the next year (twenty five) was evidently spent like the first, in organizing the southern half of the future Asiatic empire, the northern half being still unsubdued. When he returned, his building at Karnak was sufficiently far advanced to record upon the walls of one of the chambers the plants and animals of Asia which he had found on his march and brought home with him to beautify the garden of the temple of Amon,’ the sacred lake of which he supplied with a masonry coping. No records of the fourth campaign have survived, but the course of his subsequent operations was such that it must have been confined like the others to the territory already regained.

Everywhere he had her name erased and in the terraced temple on all the walls both her figure and her name have been hacked out. Her partisans doubtless all fled. If not they must have met short shrift. In the relief-scenes in the same temple, where Senmut and Nehsi and Thutiy had been so proud to appear, their names and their figures were ruthlessly chiselled away. The queen had given Senmut three statues in the Theban temples and on all these his name was erased; in his tomb and on his mor- tuary stela his name vanished. A statue of the vizier Hapu- seneb was treated in the same way.' Thutiy’s tomb was likewise visited and his name obliterated, the tomb of Senmen, Senmut’s brother, did not escape, and the name of a colleague of theirs who was buried in the next tomb was so effectually erased that we do not know who he was. Even distant Silsileh was visited at the king’s orders that the tomb of the queen’s ‘‘chief steward’’ might be dealt with in the same way.” And these mutilated monuments stand to this day, grim witnesses of the great king’s vengeance.

He then re- turned to Egypt, possibly not for the first time, by water. * All was now in readiness for the long planned advance upon Kadesh. It had taken five campaigns to gain the south and the coast; the sixth was at last directed against his long invulnerable enemy.

In spite of his display of force at Simyra, Ullaza, a harbour-town near Simyra, had showed serious dis- affection, owing to encouragement from the king of Tunip, who sent his two sons to conduct the revolt. On the 27th of April, Thutmose appeared in the harbour of the recreant city; he made short work of the place and captured the king of Tunip’s son.? The local dynasts came in as usual with their submission and Thutmose collected about one hundred and eighty five pounds of silver from them and the captured city, besides great quantities of natural produce.* He then sailed from harbour to harbour along the coast, dis- playing his force and thoroughly organizing the administra- tion of the cities. In particular he saw to it that every harbour-town should be liberally supplied with provisions for his coming campaign in Naharin.

The advancement of Egypt’s Asiatic frontier to the Kuphrates again was, in the light of past experience, not an achievement from which he might expect lasting results; nor was Thutmose III the man to drop the work he had begun as if it were complete with the campaign of the year thirty three. The spring of the thirty fourth year therefore found him again in Zahi on his ninth campaign.* Some dis- affection, probably in the Lebanon region, obliged him to take three towns, one of which at least was in the district of Nuges, where he had erected a fortress at the close of the first campaign.‘ Considerable spoil was captured and the Syrian dynasts as usual hastened to pay their tribute and express their loyalty.© Meanwhile the magazines of the harbour-towns were replenished as formerly, but especially with ships for the fleet, and with masts and spars for naval repairs. The tribute of the year was rendered notable by a present of one hundred and eight blocks of copper, weigh- ing nearly four pounds apiece, beside some lead and costly stones from the king of Cyprus, who had not heretofore rec- ognized the might of Thutmose in this manner.’", "question": "Who was Thaneni, and what was the ultimate fate of his detailed historical records?", "answer": "Thaneni, a scribe appointed by Thutmose III, carefully recorded the king's victories and daily happenings throughout each campaign on rolls of leather.

At the time of the feast of Opet, that is in October, shortly after his return, Thutmose made a tour of inspection throughout Egypt, closely questioning the local authorities wherever he landed, for the purpose of suppressing corruption in the local administration by preventing all collusion between them and the officers of the central government in extor- tionate oppression of the people while collecting taxes.? On these journeys, too, he had opportunity of observing the progress on the noble temples which he was either erecting, restoring or adorning at over thirty different places of which we know, and many more which have perished. He revived the long neglected Delta and from there to the third cataract his buildings were rising, strung like gems, along the river. He built a new town with its temple at the mouth of the Fayum; while at Dendereh, Coptos, Hl Kab, Edfu, Kom Ombo, Elephantine and many other places his captives of war and his imperial revenues were producing the magnifi- eent works which he and his architects planned.

Envoys from the north and south were con- stantly appearing at the court. Phcenician galleys, such as the upper Nile had never seen before delighted the eyes of the curious crowd at the docks of Thebes; and from these landed whole cargoes of the finest stuffs of Phcenicia, gold and silver vessels of magnificent workmanship, from the cunning hand of the Tyrian artificer or the workshops of distant Asia Minor, Cyprus, Crete and the A\\gean islands; exquisite furniture of carved ivory, delicately wrought ebony, chariots mounted with gold and electrum, and bronze implements of war; besides these, fine horses for the Phar- aoh’s stables and untold quantities of the best that the fields, gardens, vineyards, orchards and pastures of Asia produced. Under heavy guard emerged from these ships, too, the annual tribute of gold and silver in large commercial rings, some of which weighed as much as twelve pounds each, while others for purposes of daily trade were of but a few grains weight.

The tale is probably the prototype of ‘‘ Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.’’ But Thutiy was not a creation of fancy; his tomb, though now unknown, must exist some- where in Thebes, for it was plundered many years ago by the natives, who took from it some of the rich gifts which Thutmose gave him as a reward for his valour. <A splendid golden dish, which found its way into the Louvre, bears the words: ‘‘Given as a distinction from king Thutmose III to the prince and priest who satisfies the king in every country, and the isles in the midst of the sea, filling the treasury with lapis-lazuli, silver and gold, the governor of countries, com- mander of the army, favourite of the king, the king’s scribe, Thutiy.’’*?

Thaneni tells us of his duties with great pride, saying: ‘‘I followed king Thutmose III; I beheld the victories of the king which he won in every country.

The old seclusiveness had totally disappeared, the wall of partition between Asia and Africa, already shaken by the Hyksos, was now broken down completely by the wars of Thutmose III. Traditional limits disappeared, the cur- rents of life eddied no longer within the landmarks of tiny kingdoms, but pulsed from end to end of a great empire, embracing many kingdoms and tongues, from the upper Nile to the upper Euphrates. The wealth of Asiatic trade, cir- culating through the eastern end of the Mediterranean, which once flowed down the Euphrates to Babylon, was thus di- verted to the Nile Delta, centuries earlier united by canal with the Red Sea. All the world traded in the Delta mar- kets. Assyria was still in her infancy and Babylonia no longer possessed any political influence in the west. The Pharaoh looked forward to an indefinite lease of power throughout the vast empire which he had conquered. Of his administration in Asia we know very little. The whole region was under the general control of a ‘‘governor of the north countries’’; Thutmose III’s general, Thutiy, being the first to hold that office.

In any case, at his advanced age he might have been pardoned for avoiding so arduous an expedition after a long campaign. It is also probable that the season was too far advanced for him to undertake so long a march before the cold of winter should set in. However, as the event proved, no further display of force in the north was necessary. Never again as long as the old king lived did the Asiatic princes make any attempt to shake off his yoke.

He returned by way of Lebanon where he forced the chiefs to furnish him with a cargo of cedar for the sacred barge of Amon at Thebes.* Arriving at Thebes, he settled a colony of the prisoners, possibly from the city of Gezer in Palestine,? in the enclosure of his mortuary temple, which he had erected by those of his ancestors on the plain at Thebes. Perhaps the recognition of a common enemy in the Kheta now produced a rapprochement between the Pharaoh and Mitanni, for the latter was soon to suffer from the aggressions of the king of Kheta. Thutmose evi- dently desired a friend in the north, for he sent to Artatama, the Mitannian king, and desired his daughter in marriage.® After some proper display of reluctance, Artatamaconsented, and the Mitannian princess was sent to Egypt, where she probably received an Egyptian name, Mutemuya, and became the mother of the next king of Egypt, Amenhotep III. A firm alliance with Mitanni was thus formed, which forbade all thought of future conquest by the Pharaoh east of the Euphrates. A friendly alliance was also cemented with Babylonia.® Although it is probable that Thutmose found it unnecessary to invade Asia again, he was called the ‘‘con- queror of Syria’’ by his nobles,’ and the tribute of the Syrian princes regularly appeared at the office of the vizier or the treasurer..

He was therefore unable to beautify Thebes and adorn the state temple as his fathers had done. But the respect in which he held his grandfather, Thutmose III, led him to the completion of a notable work of the latter. For thirty five years the last obelisk planned by Thutmose III had been lying unfinished at the southern portal of the Karnak temple enclosure or temenos. His grandson now had it engraved in the old conqueror’s name, recorded also upon it his own pious deed in continuing the work, and erected the colossal shaft, one hundred and five and a half feet high, the largest surviving obelisk, at the southern portal of the enclosure, where he had found it lying. It now stands before the Lateran in Rome. Not long after this gracious act, which may possibly have been in celebration of his own jubi- lee, Thutmose was gathered to his fathers (about 1411 B. C.) and was buried in the valley where they slept (Fig. 122). The son who succeeded him was the third of the Amen- hoteps and the last of the great emperors. He was but the great grandson of Thutmose III, but with him the high tide of Egyptian power was already slowly on the ebb, and he was not the man to stem the tide. An early evidence of the effeminate character, which he afterward showed, is notice- able in his relation with his queen. Already as crown prince, or at least early in his reign he married a remarkable woman, of uncertain origin, named Tiy. There is not a par- ticle of evidence to prove her of foreign birth, as is so often claimed. In celebration of the marriage, Amenhotep issued a large number of scarabs, or sacred beetles, carved in stone and engraved with a record® of the event, in which the unti- 11I, 829. 211, 824, 311, 861-2. 330 A HISTORY OF EGYPT tled parentage of his queen frankly follows her name in the very royal titulary itself, which declares her to be the queen- ecnsort.

He refers to the fact that Amenhotep had received from his father a daughter in marriage, and makes this relationship a reason for further gifts of gold. As the correspondence goes on another marriage is negotiated between a daughter of Amenhotep and Kallimma-Sin or his son. Similarly Amenhotep enjoys the most intimate connection with Shut- tarna, the king of Mitanni, the son of Artatama, with whom his father, Thutmose IV, had enjoyed the most cordial rela- tions.

It now stands before the Lateran in Rome. Not long after this gracious act, which may possibly have been in celebration of his own jubi- lee, Thutmose was gathered to his fathers (about 1411 B. C.) and was buried in the valley where they slept (Fig. 122). The son who succeeded him was the third of the Amen- hoteps and the last of the great emperors. He was but the great grandson of Thutmose III, but with him the high tide of Egyptian power was already slowly on the ebb, and he was not the man to stem the tide. An early evidence of the effeminate character, which he afterward showed, is notice- able in his relation with his queen. Already as crown prince, or at least early in his reign he married a remarkable woman, of uncertain origin, named Tiy. There is not a par- ticle of evidence to prove her of foreign birth, as is so often claimed. In celebration of the marriage, Amenhotep issued a large number of scarabs, or sacred beetles, carved in stone and engraved with a record® of the event, in which the unti- 11I, 829. 211, 824, 311, 861-2. 330 A HISTORY OF EGYPT tled parentage of his queen frankly follows her name in the very royal titulary itself, which declares her to be the queen- ecnsort.

From the beginning the new queen exerted a powerful influence over Amenhotep, and he immediately inserted her name in the official caption placed at the head of royal documents. Her power continued throughout his reign and was the beginning of a remarkable era characterized by the prominence of the queens in state affairs and on public occasions, a peculiarity which we find only under Amenhotep III and his immediate successors. The significance of these events we shall later dwell upon. In the administration of Lis great empire Amenhotep III began well. The Asiatics gave him no trouble at his acces- sion, and he ruled in security and unparalleled splendour. Toward the close of his fourth year, however, trouble in Nubia called him south. Early in October he had improved the high water to pass the cataract with his fleet. His vice- roy of Nubia, Mermose, had levied an army of Nubians in the region from the vicinity of Kubban for seventy five miles up to Ibrim.* These, with the Pharaoh’s Egyptians, were to be employed against the Nubians of the upper country, a striking evidence of the very Egyptianized character of lower Nubia. When they had reached Ibhet, which is at least above the second cataract, they found the enemy and engaged them in battle, probably on the anniversary of the king’s coronation, the first day of his fifth year. They took seven hundred and forty prisoners and slew three hundred and twelve, as recorded on a tablet of victory which they set up at the second cataract.* The outlying villages and wells were visited by small parties and the inhabitants punished to prevent further recurrences of insubordination ;* where- 1TI, 862. 21, 852. 31I, 853-4, 4 TI, 850.

Nor were they less beautiful for their great size, being in every respect masterpieces of exquisite proportion, with capitals of the graceful, spreading papyrus-flower type (Fig. 130). These columns were higher than those ranged on both sides of the middle, thus producing a higher roof over a central aisle or nave and a lower roof over the side aisles, the differ- ence in level being filled with grated stone windows in a clear-story. Thus were produced the fundamental elements in basilica and cathedral architecture, which we owe to the Theban architects of Amenhotep ILI. Unfortunately the vast hall was unfinished at the death of the king, and his son was too ardent an enemy of Amon to carry out the work of his father. His later successors walled up the mag- nificent nave with drums from the columns of the side aisles which were never set up, and the whole stands to-day a mournful wreck of an unfinished work of art, the first example of a type for which the world cannot be too grateful. Amenhotep now proceeded to give the great buildings of the city a unity which they had not before possessed.

C. on), when the ratio was twelve to one. Such trade required protection and regulation. Roving bands of Lycian pirates infested the coasts of the eastern Mediterranean; they boldly entered the harbours of Cyprus and plundered the towns, and even landed on the coast of the Delta... Amenhotep was therefore obliged to develop a marine police which patroled the coast of the Delta and con- stantly held the mouths of the river closed against all but lawful comers. Custom houses were also maintained by these police officials at the same places, and all merchandise not consigned to the king was dutiable.2, The income from this source must have been very large, but we have no means of estimating it.

On New Year’s Day the king presented his nobles with a profusion of costly gifts which would have amazed the Pharachs of the pyra- mid-age.

{"context": "The world and all that is in it existed as thought in his mind; and his thoughts, like his plans for buildings and works of art, needed but to be expressed in spoken words to take concrete form as material realities. Gods and men alike proceeded from mind, and all that they do is but the mind of the god working in them. A priest of Ptah has expressed this in a short poem, a part.of which vaguely and indefinitely shows how the minds of the time were explaining the world: Ptah, the great, is the mind and tongue of the gods. . . . Ptah, from whom proceeded the power Of the mind, And of the tongue. That which comes forth from every mind, And from every mouth: Of all gods, of all people, of all cattle, of all reptiles, That live, thinking and commanding Everything that he (Ptah) wills. It (the mind) is the one that bringeth forth every successful issue. It is the tongue which repeats the thought of the mind: It (the mind) was the fashioner of all gods. . . . At a time when every divine word Came into existence by the thought of the mind, And the command of the tongue.\" Wherever we have used the word ‘‘mind”’ in this passage the Egyptian has ‘‘heart,’’ which word served him for ‘‘mind’’ in exactly the same way as the Hebrews and many other peoples frequently employ it; much in the same man- 1See the author’s account of this remarkable document, Zeitschrift fiir Aegyptische Sprache, XXXIX, 39 ff. 358 A HISTORY OF EGYPT ner indeed as we ourselves often use it, with the difference that the Egyptian believed the heart and the bowels actually to be the seat of mind. Although such notions could have: been entertained by very limited circles, they were not con- fined to the priests alone. Intef, the court herald of Thut- mose ITI, states on his tombstone that he owed his success to the guidance of his ‘‘heart,’’ to which he listened implicitly ; and he adds that the people said: ‘‘Lo, it is an oracle of the god, which is in every body.’’! ‘‘ Body’’ is here, as com- monly, the word for abdomen or bowels, the seat of mind. The Egyptian had thus gained the idea of a single controlling intelligence, behind and above all sentient beings, including the gods. The efficient force by which this intelligence put his designs into execution was his spoken ‘‘word,’’ and this primitive ‘‘logos’’ is undoubtedly the incipient germ of the later logos-doctrine which found its origin in Egypt. Early Greek philosophy may also have drawn upon it.", "question": "What significant philosophical concept regarding a single controlling intelligence and its method of action emerged in ancient Egypt?", "answer": "Ancient Egyptians developed the concept of a single controlling intelligence, which was above all sentient beings including gods, and this intelligence put its designs into execution through its spoken \"word,\" forming a primitive \"logos\" doctrine."}
{"context": "But Ikhnaton no longer attempted to act as High Priest himself; one of his favourites, Merire (‘‘Beloved of Re’’) was appointed by him to the office, coming one day for this purpose with his friends to the balcony of the palace, in which the king and queen appeared in state. The king then formally promoted Merire to the exalted office, saying: ‘‘ Behold, I am appoint- ing thee for myself to be ‘Great Seer’ [High Priest] of the Aton in the temple of Aton in Akhetaton. . . . I give to thee the office saying, ‘Thou shalt eat the food of Pharaoh, thy lord, in the house of Aton.’’’* Merire was so faithful in the administration of the temple that the king publicly rewarded him with ‘‘the gold,’’ the customary distinction granted to zealous servitors of the Pharaoh. At the door of one of the temple buildings the king, queen and two daughters extend to the fortunate Merire the rewards of fidelity, and the king says to the attendants: ‘‘Hang gold at his neck before and behind, and gold on his legs; because of his hearing the teaching of Pharaoh concerning every saying in these beau- tiful seats which Pharaoh has made in the sanctuary in the Aton-temple in Akhetaton.’’* It thus appears that Merire had given heed to the king’s teachings regarding the ritual of the temple, or, as he says, ‘‘every saying in these beautiful seats.’ It becomes more and more evident that all that was devised and done in the new city and in the propagation of the Aton faith is directly due to the king and bears the stamp of his individuality. A king who did not hesitate to erase his own father’s name on the monuments in order to annihilate Amon, the great foe of his revolutionary movement, was not one to stop half way, and the men about him must have been involuntarily carried on at his imperious will.

He therefore wrote Aziru granting him the year which he had asked for before he appeared at court, but Aziru contrived to evade Khani, the Egyptian bearer of the king’s letter, which was thus broughtback to Egypt without being delivered.* It shows the astonishing leniency of Ikhnaton in a manner which would indicate that he was opposed to measures of force, such as his fathers had employed.

Their remains have been found from the western coast of Asia Minor eastward to the plains of Syria and the Euphra- tes, and southward as far as Hamath. They were a non- Semitic people, or rather peoples, of uncertain racial affini- ties, but evidently distinct from, and preceding, the Indo- Germanic influx after 1200 B. C. which brought in the Phryg- ians (see p. 478). As shown on the Egyptian monuments, they are beardless, with long hair hanging in two prominent locks before their ears and dropping to the shoulders; but their own native monuments often give them a heavy beard (Wig. 146). On the head they most often wore tall pointed caps like a sugar-loaf hat, but with little brim. As their cli- mate demands, they wear heavy woollen clothing, usually in a long, close-fitting garment, depending from the shoulders and reaching to the knees or sometimes the ankles; while the feet are shod in high boots turned up at the toes. They possessed a crude, but by no means primitive, art which produced very creditable monuments in stone (Figs. 145-6) still scattered over the hills of Asia Minor. Their skill in the practical arts was considerable, and they produced a red figured pottery above mentioned which was disseminated in trade from the centre of its manufacture in Cappadocia to the Aigean on the west, and eastward through Syria and Palestine to Lachish and Gezer on the south. Already by 2000 B. C. we remember it had perhaps reached the latter place. They were masters of the art of writing, and the king had his personal scribe ever with him.’ Their pictographic records are still in course of decipherment, and enough progress has not yet been made to enable the scholar to do more than recognize a word here and there.

A new spirit has breathed upon the dry bones of traditionalism in Egypt, and he who reads these lines for the first time must be moved with involuntary admiration for the young king who in such an age found such thoughts in his heart. He grasped the idea of a world- dominator, as the creator of nature, in which the king saw revealed the creator’s beneficent purpose for all his creat- ures, even the meanest; for the birds fluttering about in the lily-grown Nile-marshes to him seemed to be uplifting their wings in adoration of their creator; and even the fish in the stream leaped up in praise to God. It is his voice that summons the blossoms and nourishes the chicklet or com- mands the mighty deluge of the Nile. He called Aton,‘‘the father and the mother of all that he had made,’’ and he saw in some degree the goodness of that All-Father as did he who bade us consider the lilies. He based the universal sway of God upon his fatherly care of all men alike, irre- spective of race or nationality, and to the proud and exclu- sive Hgyptian he pointed to the all-embracing bounty of the common father of humanity, even placing Syria and Nubia Fic. 142.—LIMESTONE TORSO OF IKH- Fie, 143 —HEAD OF IKHNATON.

The infantry, among which foreign mercenaries were plentiful, bore bow and arrows, sword and spear and often an axe. They fought in close phalanx formation, very effective at close quarters; but their chief power consisted of chariotry. The chariot itself was more heavily built than in Egypt, as it bore three men, driver, bowman and shield-bearer, while the Egyptian dis- dispensed with the third man. One of the Hittite dynasts had consolidated a kingdom beyond the Amanus, which Thutmose III regularly called ‘‘Great Kheta,’’ as prob- ably distinguished from the less important independent Hittite princes. His capital was a great fortified city called ‘‘Khatti’’ (identified in 1907), situated at modern Boghaz-kéi, east of Angora and the Halys (Kisil-irmak) river in eastern Asia Minor. Active trade and inter- course between this kingdom and Kgypt had been car- ried on from that time or began not long after.’ This reached such proportions that the king of Cyprus was apprehensivelest too close relations between Egypt and the Hittite kingdom (‘‘Great Kheta’’) might endanger his own position.2 When Ikhnaton ascended the throne Seplel, the king of the Hittites, wrote him a letter of congratulation, and to all appearances had only the friendliest intentions toward Egypt.? For the first invasions of the most advanced Hittites, like that which Dushratta of Mitanni repulsed, he may indeed not have been responsible. Even after Ikhnaton’s removal to Akhetaton, his new capital, a Hittite embassy appeared there with gifts and greetings.* But Tkhnaton must have regarded the old relations as no longer desirable, for the Hittite king asks him why he has ceased the correspondence ® which his father had maintained. If he realized the situation, Ikhnaton had good reason indeed for abandoning the connection; for the Hittite empire now stood on the northern threshold of Syria, the most for- midable enemy which had ever confronted", "question": "What was the name and location of the capital city of the Hittite kingdom referred to as \"Great Kheta\"?", "answer": "The capital of the Hittite kingdom, which Thutmose III called \"Great Kheta,\" was a great fortified city named \"Khatti,\" identified at modern Boghaz-koi, east of Angora and the Halys river in eastern Asia Minor."}

He took the greatest delight in his children and appeared with them and the queen, their mother, on all possible occasions, as if he had been but the humblest scribe in the Aton-temple. He had himself depicted on the monuments while enjoying the most familiar and unaffected 378 A HISTORY OF EGYPT intercourse with his family, and whenever he appeared in the temple to offer sacrifice the queen and the daughters she had borne him participated in the service. All that was natural was to him true, and he never failed practically to exemplify this belief, however radically he was obliged to disregard tradition. Such a principle unavoidably affected the art of the time in which the king took great interest. Bek, his chief sculp- tor, appended to his title the words, ‘‘whom his majesty himself taught.’’! Thus the artists of his court were taught to make the chisel and the brush tell the story of what they actually saw. The result was a simple and beautiful real- ism that saw more clearly than ever any art had seen before (Figs. 119, 147-8). They caught the instantaneous postures of animal life; the coursing hound, the fleeing game, the wild bull leaping in the swamp (Fig. 144); for all these belonged to the ‘‘truth,’’ in which Ikhnaton lived. The king’s person was no exception to the law of the new art. The monuments of Egypt bore what they had never borne before, a Pharaoh not frozen in the conventional posture demanded by the traditions of court propriety (Figs. 141, 143). The modelling of the human figure at this time was so plastic that at the first glance one is sometimes in doubt whether he has before him a product of the Greek age (Fig. 142). Even complex compositions of grouped figures in the round were now first conceived. Fragments recently discovered show that in the palace court at Akhetaton, a group in stone depicted the king speeding his chariot at the heels of the wounded lion. This was indeed a new chapter in the history of art, even though now lost. It was in some things an obscure chapter; for the strange treat- ment of the lower limbs by Ikhnaton’s artists is a problem which still remains unsolved and cannot be wholly ac- counted for by supposing a mal-formation of the king’s own limbs.", "question": "What artistic style emerged during Ikhnaton's reign, and how did his personal philosophy influence it?", "answer": "Ikhnaton's belief that 'what was was right' and his emphasis on 'truth' led to a simple and beautiful realism in art.

Long afterward its Aton temple became a temple of ‘‘ Amon, Lord of Gem-Aton,’’ and thus in far-off Nubia the ruins of the earliest temple of monotheism still stand.’ On reaching Thebes, Tutenkhaton continued the worship of Aton and made some enlargement or at least repairs of the Aton-temple there; but he was obliged by the priests of Amon to permit the resumption of Amon-worship. In- deed he was constrained to restore the old festal calendar - of Karnak and Luxor; he himself conducted the first ‘‘feast of Opet,’’ the greatest of all the festivals of Amon, and restored the temples there.? Expediency also obliged him to begin restoring the disfigured name of Amon, expunged from the monuments by Ikhnaton, and his restorations are found as far south as Soleb in Nubia.* He was then forced 1See reference, p. 364, note 1. 2 Luxor reliefs, ibid., 34, 135. 311, 896. 394 A HISTORY OF EGYPT to another serious concession to the priests of Amon; he changed his name to Tutenkhamon. ‘‘Living image of Amon,’’ showing that he was now completely in the hands of the priestly party.’ The empire which he ruled was still no mean one, ex- tending as it did from the Delta of the Nile to the fourth cataract.

He established for them daily offerings every day. All the vessels of their temples were wrought of silver and gold.

The people resumed in public the worship of the innumerable gods which they had practised in secret during the supremacy of Aton. The sculptors of the king were sent throughout the land con- tinuing the restoration begun by Tutenkhamon, reinserting on the monuments defaced by Ikhnaton, the names of the gods whom he had dishonoured and erased. Over and over again appear in the temple of Amon at Karnak the records of such restoration by command of Harmhab. All this must have ensured to him the united support of the priestly party throughout the land. At the same time, the worship of Aton, while not forbidden, was in many places suppressed by the destruction of his sanctuaries. At Thebes Harmhab razed to the ground the temple of Aton and used the ma- terials for building two pylons (Fig. 149), extending the temple of Amon on the south; and the materials which he left unused were employed in similar works by his succes- sors.

He met them in battle at some unknown point in the western Delta,? and according to the meagre accounts which he has left us, was able to return in triumph to Thebes with the usual prisoners and spoil to be presented in the temple of Amon.* It is possible that this return to Thebes did not take place immediately, but that he proceeded to Asia after the overthrow of the Libyans, to continue the restoration of Egyptian power in Syria which he had begun so auspiciously the season before. In any case, we next find him in Galilee, storming the walled city of Kadesh, which must not be confused with Kadesh on the Orontes. Here the Amorite kingdom, founded by Abdashirta and Aziru, as we were able to follow it in the letters of Rib-Addi, ‘ formed a kind of buffer state, to which the Galilean Kadesh belonged, lying between Palestine on the south and the southern Hittite frontier in the Orontes valley on the north. It was necessary for Seti to subdue this intermediate king- dom before he could come to blows with the Hittites lying behind it.

While he was still serving the Pharaoh, in the days of his official eareer, he had built a tomb of the most superb and artistic workmanship at Memphis (Figs. 119, 147-8, 150). It wasa characteristic of the man that he did not abandon this Mem- phite tomb and order one more splendid at Thebes in the Valley of the Kings’ Tombs. He left untouched upon its walls all his old official titles as general, etc., which we have already quoted, merely placing alongside them his royal names and the Pharaonic titulary. Wherever his figure appeared among the reliefs in the tomb chapel, he caused the royal ureeus serpent to be inserted on the forehead (Fig. 150), thus clearly distinguishing the figure as that of a king.' These insertions may still be traced at the present day. The fruits of Harmhab’s reorganization were destined to be enjoyed by his successors. Whether or not he succeeded in founding a dynasty we do not know. It is impossible to discover any certain connection between him and Ramses I, who now (1315 B. C.) succeeded him, but as Ramses I was already of advanced age on his accession, he must have had some legal title to the throne. Otherwise at such an age he would hardly have been able to make good his claims. He was too old to accomplish anything or to utilize the resources of the new nation which Harmhab had built up. He planned and began the vast colonnaded hall, the famous hypostyle of Karnak, afterward continued and completed by his successors. In his second year he found the new responsibility beyond his strength and he associated as co- regent with himself his son, Seti I,’ then probably about thirty years old. Together with his son he may have organ- ized a campaign in Nubia, for in any case in the same year he was able to add ‘‘slaves of the captivity of his majesty’’ to the endowment of the Nubian temple at Wadi Halfa.*° The inscription recording this and other gifts to the said temple‘ is the only dated monument of Ramses I’s reign, 1YTI, 1-21. 2]II, 157. 3TIl, 78. ‘Til, 74 ff.

He returned to Thebes for another triumph, driving his Hittite prisoners before him, and presenting them, with the spoil, to the god of the Empire, Amon of Karnak.! The boundary which he had established in Asia roughly coincided inland with the north- ern limits of Palestine, and must have included also Tyre and the Phenician coast south of the mouth of the Litany. Though much increasing the territory of Egypt in Asia, it represented but a small third of what she had once con- quered there. Under these circumstances, it would have been quite natural for Seti to continue the war in Syria. For some reason, however, he did not, in so far as we know, ever appear with his forces in Asia again. He possibly recognized the hopelessness of a struggle against the Hit- tites, who were now so firmly entrenched in Syria. The position of Egypt in Syria was indeed totally different from that of the Hittites, who were actually occupying the coun- try, the warrior class at least residing there; whereas the Pharaohs had never attempted to colonize the country, but merely to hold it in vassalage, subject to the payment of yearly tribute.

Had the Phar- aoh succeeded in evicting them it would have required inces- sant war in northern Syria to have kept them within their old limits. Seti may have perceived the changed conditions and understood that the methods which had built up the empire of Thutmose III could no longer apply with a power of the first rank already occupying Syria. He therefore, either at this time or later, negotiated a treaty of peace with the Hittite king, Metella, who had succeeded his father, Merasar.? 1 III, 145-152. 21II, 377. ¢14 A HISTORY OF EGYPT Returning to Egypt, he devoted himself to the interests of peace, especially to the temples of the gods. The deface- ment of the monuments during the Aton revolution had been but partially repaired by Harmhab; Seti’s father had reigned too briefly to accomplish anything in this direction, so that Seti himself found much to do in merely restoring the disfigured monuments of his ancestors, which he did with admirable piety. All the larger monuments of the HKigh- teenth Dynasty from the Nubian temple of Amada on the south to Bubastis on the north, bear records of his restora- tion, with the words appended: ‘‘ Restoration of the monu- ment, which Seti I made.’ Throughout the great quarries of Egypt, Assuan, Silsileh, Gebelen, his workmen were dis- patched.” Captives of war were employed as of old, but where he utilized the labour of native Egyptians, Seti records with great pride the humane treatment and the gen- erous supplies accorded them. At Silsileh, whence the sand- stone was procured, every one of the thousand workmen employed there received daily nearly four pounds of bread, two bundles of vegetables and a roast of meat; while twice a month each man was given a clean linen garment.’ At all the great sanctuaries of the old gods his buildings were now rising on a scale unprecedented in the palmiest days of the Empire,—a fact which shows that the income, even of the reduced empire of Seti I, reaching from the fourth cataract of the Nile to the sources of the Jordan, was still . sufficient to support enterprises of imperial scope.

Although this temple has lost the first and second pylons, it still remains perhaps the noblest monument of Egyptian art still surviving in the land. To its artistic value we shall revert again.

He therefore turned his attention to the possible resources and found that the supply of gold from the mountains of the Red Sea region in the district of Gebel Zebara was seriously restricted by the difficulties which beset the route, especially in the matter of water. The road from the Nile valley thither left the river at a point a few miles above Edfu, and Seti visited the place himself to discover what might be done to remedy the difficulty. He found it necessary to go out into the desert some two days journey to a point about thirty seven miles from the river, where there was an old and probably disused station known to the caravans of the Kighteenth Dynasty.! Here, under his own superintendence, a well was dug, yielding a plentiful supply of water.2, Thereupon Seti erected a small temple by the well and established a settle- ment at the place.* In all probability other stations further out on the same route were erected. The thirsty caravaneers sang his praise: ‘‘Ye gods dwelling in the well give ye to him your duration; for he hath opened for us the way to march in, when it was closed up before us.", "question": "How did Seti I attempt to increase the supply of gold from the Red Sea region?", "answer": "Seti I addressed the restricted gold supply from the Red Sea region by personally visiting the area, ordering a well to be dug about 37 miles into the desert, and establishing a settlement there to secure a plentiful water supply for the route."}

The fraud is visible to this day, the colour by which it was once disguised having now vanished. Ramses, another son of Seti, born to him by one of his queens named Tuya, was, however, plot- ting to supplant his eldest brother, and during their father’s last days Ramses laid his plans so effectively that he was ready for a successful coup at the old king’s death. Some time before the approaching jubilee, while the obelisks for it were still unfinished, Seti died (about 1292 B. C.), having reigned over twenty years since his own father’s death. He was laid to rest in a sumptuous sarcophagus of alabaster in the splendid tomb which he had excavated in the western valley. The body then deposited in the tomb, and preserved by happy accident, like many others of the Pharaohs whom we have seen, shows him to have been one of the stateliest figures that ever sat upon the throne of Egypt, in so far as we can judge at this time from the remains preserved to us (Fig. 158). The plans of the young Ramses were immediately carried out. Whether his elder brother gained the throne long enough to have his figure inserted in his father’s reliefs or whether his influence as crown prince had accomplished this, we cannot tell.

For this purpose he sailed down the river from Thebes to Abydos,‘ which he had probably touched on his way up to Thebes. At Abydos he found has father’s magnificent mortuary temple in a sad state; it was without roof, the drums of the columns and the blocks for the half raised walls lay scat- tered in the mire, and the whole monument, left thus unfin- ished by Seti, was fast going to destruction.

Here the river left the precipitous, canon-like valley in which it had hitherto flowed, and for the first time permitted a crossing to the west side on which Kadesh was, thus enabling an army approaching the city from the south to cut off a con- siderable bend in the river.

However this may be, we find him at Memphis in his third year consulting with his officials regarding the possibility of opening up the Wadi Alaki country in Nubia and developing there the mines which Seti I had unsuccessfully attempted to exploit.” The viceroy of Kush, who was present, explained the difficulty to the king and related the fruitless attempt of his father to supply the route with water. It was now so bad that when the caravaneers attempted the desert journey thither ‘it was only half of them that arrived there; for they died of thirst on the road, together with the asses which they drove before them.’’ They were obliged to take enough water for the round trip, as they could obtain none at the mines. ‘‘Hence no gold was brought from this country for 1]II, 274-7. 2JII, 251-281. 3III, 279-281. 4TII, 281, 1. 103, note. 5]II, 282-293. 422 A HISTORY OF EGYPT lack of water.’’' With subtle flattery the viceroy and court advised another attempt to supply the route with water,’ and the result of the ensuing royal command to undertake it was a letter from the viceroy of Kush announcing the complete success of the enterprise and the discovery of a copious spring of water at a depth of only twenty feet.’ At Kubban, where the road leading to the mines left the Nile-valley, Ramses had the viceroy erect a stela commem- orating the achievement and bearing a record of the events which we have sketched.* Such enterprises of internal ex- ploitation were but preparatory in the plans of Ramses.

Nevertheless the figure of Seti with upraised spear, dispatching the Libyan chief, on this north wall at Karnak (Fig. 152), is one of the strongest and most vigourous examples of drawing to be found among the works of Egyptian artists; while as a composition it is almost equally good. The finest reliefs of the time, how- ever, are to be found in Seti’s temple at Abydos (Fig. 153), in which there is a rare combination of softness and refine- ment, with bold and sinuous lines and exquisite modelling. Hardly inferior to these are the reliefs in Seti’s magnificent tomb (Fig. 154) at Thebes. The painting of the time also continues to show much of the power of the Amarna school of art. The Theban tombs have preserved exquisite examples like the inspection of the herds (Fig. 155) or the hunt in the marshes, the latter exhibiting a fine touch of animal savagery in the fierce abandon of a lithe cat as she tramples two wild birds beneath her feet and sinks her teeth at the same moment into a third victim (Fig. 156).

A modern military critic could hardly better describe, in a word, what had happened than do these brief words from the ancient account of the affair. The attacking force was entirely chariotry and Ramses’ marching infantry was of course cut to pieces under the assault. The southern portion of this disorganized division must have entirely melted away, but the rest fled northward toward Ramses’ camp in a wild rout, having lost many pris- oners and strewing the way with their equipments.

They burst over the barricade into the aston- ished camp with the Hittite chariotry in hot pursuit close upon their heels. Ramses’ heavy infantry guard quickly dragged these intruders from their chariots and dispatched them; but behind these was swiftly massing the whole body of some twenty five hundred Asiatic chariots. As they pressed in upon the Egyptian position their wings rapidly spread, swelled out on either hand and enfolded the camp. The division of Amon, weary with the long and rapid march, in total relaxation, without arms and without officers, was struck as by an avalanche when the fleeing remnants of the division of Re swept through soooAsiatic Infantry —Egyptians = Fonlive Egyptians x Ramses Egyptian Camp (0) 5Km.

{"context": "At this juncture an incident common in oriental warfare saved Ramses from total destruction. Had the mass of the Hittite chariotry swept in upon his rear from the west and south he must certainly have been lost. But to his great good fortune his camp had fallen into the hands of these troops and, dismounting from their chariots, they had thrown discipline to the winds as they gave thera- selves up to the rich plunder. Thus engaged, they were suddenly fallen upon by a body of Ramses’ recruits who may possibly have marched in from the coast to join his army at Kadesh. At any rate, they did not belong to either of the southern divisions. They completely surprised the plundering Asiatics in the camp and slew them to a man. The sudden offensive of Ramses along the river and the unexpected onslaught of the ‘‘reeruits’’ must have consider- ably dampened the ardour of the Hittite attack, giving the 432 A HISTORY OF EGYPT Pharaoh an opportunity to recover himself. These newly arrived ‘‘recruits,’’? together with the returning fugitives from the unharmed but scattered division of Amon, so aug- mented his power that there was now a prospect of his maintaining himself till the arrival of the division of Ptah. The stubborn defense which now followed forced the Hittite king to throw in his reserves of a thousand chariots. Six times the desperate Pharaoh charged into the replenished lines of the enemy, but for some reason Metella did not send against him the eight thousand foot which he had stationed on the east side of the river opposite Ramses’ position; and the struggle remained a battle of chariotry as long as we can trace it. For three long hours, by prodigies of personal valour, the Pharaoh kept his scanty forces together, throwing many an anxious glance southward toward the road from Shabtuna, along which the division of Ptah was toiling in response to his message. Finally, as the long afternoon wore on and the sun was low in the west, the stand- ards of Ptah glimmering through the dust and heat glad- dened the eyes of the weary Pharaoh. Caught between the opposing lines, the Hittite chariotry was driven into the city, probably with considerable loss; but our sources do not permit us to follow these closing incidents of the battle.

He assumed among his titles on his monuments the phrase, ‘‘Prostrator of the lands and countries while he was alone, having no other with him.’’2 While he might satisfy his vanity with such conventional honours and take great satis- faction in the reputation for personal valour which the ex- ploit at Kadesh undoubtedly brought him; yet when he came to weigh and seriously consider the situation which he had left in Syria he must have felt dark forebodings for the future of Egyptian power in Asia. The moral effect of his return to Egypt immediately after the battle without even laying siege to Kadesh, and having lost nearly a whole division of his army, even though he had shown a brilliant defense, could only be subversive of Egyptian influence among the dynasts of Syria and Palestine. Nor would the Hittites fail to make every possible use of the doubtful battle to undermine that influence and stir up revolt. Seti lI had secured northern Palestine as Egyptian territory, and this region was so near the valley of the Orontes that the emissaries of the Hittites had little difficulty in exciting it to revolt. The rising spread southward to the very gates of Ramses’ frontier forts in the northeastern Delta.

The land of the Hittite princess is called Bekhten, probably meaning Bactria; and it is not improbable that some such occurrence took place during the intercourse between Khetasar and Ramses.” In any event the friendly relations between the two kingdoms continued without interruption, and it is even probable that Ramses received a second daughter of Khetasar in marriage.* Throughout Ramses’ long reign the treaty remained unbroken and the peace con- tinued at least into the reign of his successor, Merneptah. Ramses’ conflict with the Hittites, involving probably fifteen or sixteen years of severe campaigning in Asia, constitutes the basis of the claim to a high place as a soldier usually advanced in his behalf. His only battle which we ean closely follow bears unmistakable testimony to his bravery, but does not exhibit him as a skilful commander.

But in spite of these facts, his own legiti- mate building was on a scale quite surpassing in size and extent anything that his ancestors had ever accomplished. The buildings which he erected were filled with innumerable supplementary monuments, especially colossal statues of himself and obelisks. The former are the greatest mono- lithic statues ever executed. We have already referred to the tallest of these in the temple at Tanis; there was another granite monolith towering over the pylons of the Rames- seum at Thebes (Fig. 161) which, although not so high, weighed about a thousand tons. As the years passed and he celebrated jubilee after jubilee the obelisks which he erected in commemoration of these festivals rapidly rose among his temples. At Tanis alone he erected no less than fourteen, all of which are now prostrate; three at least of his obelisks are in Rome; and of the two which he erected in Luxor, one is in Paris.* Besides the wealth involved in its erection, every such temple demanded a rich endow- ment. After telling how his Abydos temple was built of fine limestone, with granite door-posts and doors of copper wrought with silver-gold alloy, Ramses says of its endow- ment that there were ‘‘established for him (the god) per- manent daily offerings, at the beginnings of the seasons, all feasts at their times. . . .

If the flourishing devel- opment now enjoyed by the Delta was an almost unavoid- able accompaniment of Ramses’ projects in Asia, his ener- getic spirit was not less felt throughout the kingdom, where no such motives operated. Of his buildings at Heliopolis nothing remains, and only the scantiest fragments of his temples at Memphis have survived.2, We have already noticed his extensive building operations at Abydos, in the completion of his father’s splendid temple there. With this he was not content, but erected also his own mortuary temple not far from that of Seti. At Thebes he spent enor- mous treasure and vast resources of labour in the comple- tion of his father’s mortuary temple, another beautiful sanc- tuary for his own mortuary service, known to all visitors at Thebes as the Ramesseum; a large court and pylon in enlargement of the Luxor temple; while, surpassing in size all buildings of the ancient or modern world, his architects completed the colossal colonnaded hall of the Karnak temple, already begun under the first Ramses, the Pharach’s grand- father.

Recently a preliminary draught of the Hittite copy in cuneiform on a clay tablet, was found by Winckler at Boghaz-koi in Asia Minor. It will be noticed that the treaty nowhere refers to the boundary recognized by both countries in Syria; and we can only suppose that it may have been contained in one of the earlier treaties reaffirmed by it. It is difficult to determine the exact location of this boundary. The cuneiform docu- ments found by Winckler at Boghaz-k6i since 1906 (see p. 1TTI, 373. 2TII, 367-391. THE WARS OF RAMSES I1 439 381) show that the Hittite kings continued to control Amor on the upper Orontes. It is not safe to affirm that he had permanently advanced the boundary of his father’s king- dom in Asia, save probably on the coast, where he carved two more stele on the rocks near Berut, beside that of his fourth year, with which we are already acquainted.’ The Hittite king is recognized in the treaty as on an equality with the Pharaoh and receives the same conditions; but as commonly in the orient the whole transaction was inter- preted by Ramses on his monuments as a great triumph for himself, and he now constantly designated himself as the conqueror of the Hittites.2 Once consummated, the peace was kept, and although it involved the sacrifice of Ramses’ ambitions for conquest in Asia, the treaty must have been entirely satisfactory to both the parties. Thirteen years later (1259 B. C.) the Hittite king himself visited Egypt to consummate the marriage of his eldest daughter as the wife of Ramses.

This zone did not extend to the southern half of the isthmus, but was confined to the ter- ritory between Lake Timsah and the Mediterranean, whence the line of fortresses extended southward, passed the lake and bent westward into the Wadi Tumilat.

{"context": "Numerous letters from scribes and officials of the time, exercises and practice letters composed by pupils of the scribal schools, bills, temple records and accounts,—all these serve to fill in the detail in a picture of unusual fullness - and interest. By far the larger portion of the surviving literature of the time is religious and in so far as it is the outgrowth of the state religion, the impression which it conveys is far from gratifying. Since the overthrow of Ikhnaton and the return 456 A HISTORY OF EGYPT to the conventions of the past, the state religion had lost all vitality, and in the hands of the orthodox priests no longer possessed the creative faculty. Yet the religion of the time was making a kind of progress, or at least it was moving in a certain direction and that very rapidly. The state, always closely connected with religion, was gradually being more and more regarded as chiefly a religious insti- tution, designed to exalt and honour the gods through its head the Pharaoh. Among other indications of this ten- dency the names of the temples furnish a significant hint. Sanctuaries which formerly bore names lke ‘‘Splendour of Splendours,’’ ‘‘Splendid in Monuments,’’ ‘‘ Gift of Life,’ and the like, were now designated ‘‘ Dwelling of Seti in the House of Amon,’’ or ‘‘ Dwelling of Ramses in the House of Ptah.’’ This tendency, already observable in the Middle Kingdom, was now universal, and every temple was thus designated as the sanctuary of the ruling Pharaoh. That which had long been the sacerdotal theory and ideal of the state was now beginning to be practically realized: the Empire was to become the domain of the gods and the Pharaoh was to give himself up to the duties of a universal high-priesthood. The temple endowments, not being sub- ject to taxes, now played an important economic role, and we have seen Seti I and Ramses in search of new sources of revenue as the demands of the priesthoods increased. The state was being gradually distorted to fulfill one fune- tion at the expense of all the rest, and its wealth and eco- nomic resources were thus being slowly engulfed, until its industrial processes should become but incidents in the main- tenance of the gods. As the wealth and power of Amon in particular increased, his High Priest at Thebes became a more and more important political factor.", "question": "How did the perception of the state's role in Egypt evolve after Ikhnaton's revolution?", "answer": "The state was increasingly regarded as primarily a religious institution, designed to exalt and honor the gods through the Pharaoh, which was reflected in new temple naming conventions and the idea of the Empire becoming the domain of the gods."}

Already in the Middle Kingdom there had grown up collections of artless folk-tales woven often about a historical motive, and such tales, clothed in 454 A HISTORY OF EGYPT the simple language of the people, had early in the High- teenth Dynasty gained sufficient literary respectability to be put into writing. While the Highteenth Dynasty pos- sessed such tales as these, yet by far the larger part of our surviving manuscripts of this class date from the Nine- teenth Dynasty and later. It is now that we find the story of the conflict between the Hyksos king Apophis and Se- kenere at Thebes a tale of which the lost conclusion doubt- less contained a popular version of the expulsion of the Hyksos. The reader will recall its contribution to our scanty knowledge of the Hyksos.1 The people now loved to dwell upon the exploits of Thutmose III’s commanders, telling of Thutiy and his capture of Joppa by introducing his soldiers into the city in panniers loaded on donkeys, a tale which was perhaps the prototype of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. But the artless charm of the story of the doomed prince quite surpasses such historical tales. An only son, he is doomed by the Hathors at his birth to die by a crocodile, a serpent or a dog. Journeying to Syria, he succeeds in climbing a tower in which the king of Naharin had confined his daughter, that he among the young nobles of Syria whose strength of arm and steady nerve should enable him to swing himself aloft to the young girl’s window might lead her away as his wife. But, as the prince had not divulged his real identity, having given himself out to be the son of an Egyptian officer, the king of Naharin refused to give him his daughter and afterward would have killed him. At this juncture the young girl saved her lover by avowing her firm intention of slaying herself if they slew him. The king then relented and the prince received his bride. Having escaped the crocodile and the serpent it is probable that he then fell a victim to his faith- ful dog which had followed him from Egypt, but the end of the story is wanting.

It is at this time that we gain our sole glimpse into the religious beliefs of the common people. The appropriation of the temples by the state had long ago driven them from their ancient shrines. The poor man had no place amid such magnificance, nor could he offer anything worthy the attention of a god of such splen- dour. The old modest cult of the great gods having long since passed away, the poor man could only resort to the host of minor genii or spirits of mirth and music, the demi- gods, who, frequenting this or that local region, had interest and inclination to assist the humble in their daily cares and needs.

All such buildings were emblazoned with gayly col- oured reliefs depicting the valiant deeds of the Pharaoh in his various wars, especially, as we have already noticed, his desperate defence at the battle of Kadesh (Fig. 169).

Then came famine, with all the misery which the Arab historians later depict in their annals of similar periods under the Mamluke sultans in Egypt. Indeed the record of this period left us by Ramses III in the great Papyrus Harris,? in spite of its brevity, reads like a chapter from the rule of some Mamluke sultan of the fourteenth century. Profiting by the helplessness of the people and the preoccupation of the native rulers, one of those Syrians who had held an official position at the court seized the crown, or at least the power, and ruled in tyranny and violence. ‘‘He set the whole land tributary before him together; he united his companions and plundered their pos- sessions. They made the gods like men and no offerings were presented in the temples.’’? Property rights were therefore no longer respected and even the revenues of the temples were diverted. As might have been expected the Libyans were not long in perceiving the helplessness of Egypt. Immigration across the western frontier of the Delta began again; plundering bands wandered among the towns from the vicinity of Mem- phis to the Mediterranean, or took possession of the fields and settled on both shores of the Canopic branch.* At this juncture, about 1200 B.

Under these circumstances, Mer- neptah had no hesitation in resorting to the most brutal destruction of the monuments of his ancestors. To obtain materials for his mortuary temple he made a quarry of the noble sanctuary of Amenhotep III on the western plain, ruthlessly tore down its walls and split up its superb statues to serve as blocks in his own building.

Ramses III inherited a situation precisely like that which confronted Merneptah at his accession; but being a young and vigourous man, he was better able suc- cessfully to cope with it. He immediately perfected the organization for military service, dividing all the people into classes successively liable for such service. A large proportion of the standing army, not exactly determinable, consisted of Sherden mercenaries, as in Ramses II’s day, while a contingent of the Kehek, a Libyan tribe, was also in the ranks.1. These mercenaries of course served as long as they were eligible. Since the native contingent was con- stantly shifting, as class after class passed through the army, the Pharaoh came more and more to depend upon the mercenaries as the permanent element in his army. The affairs of the newly organized government gave Ramses no opportunity to deal with the chronic situation in the western Delta until he was rudely awakened to the necessity for action, as Merneptah had been. But more serious develop- ments had taken place since the latter’s Libyan war. The restless and turbulent peoples of the northern Mediterranean, whom the Egyptians designated the ‘‘peoples of the sea,’’ were showing themselves in ever increasing numbers in the south.

{"context": "Ramses found it necessary to appear in Amor with his army. The limits and the course of the campaign are but obscurely hinted at in the meagre records now surviving.’ He stormed at least five strong cities, one of which was in Amor; another depicted in Ramses’ reliefs as surrounded by water was perhaps Kadesh; a third, rising upon a hill, cannot be identified; and both of the remaining two, one of which was called Ereth,” were defended by Hit- tites. He probably did not penetrate far into the Hittite ter- ritory, although its cities were rapidly falling away from the Hittite king and much weakened by the attacks of the sea- peoples. It was the last hostile passage between the Pharaoh and the Hittites; both empires were swiftly declining to their fall, and in the annals of Egypt we never again hear of the Hittites in Syria. Ramses places in his lists* of conquered regions the cities of northern Syria to the Euphrates, includ- ing all that the Empire had ever ruled in its greatest days.

The reliefs which cover the vast surfaces of the Medinet Habu temple are with few exceptions but weak imitations of the fine sculptures of Seti I at Karnak, badly drawn and exe- cuted without feeling. Only here and there do we find a flash of the old-time power, as in the representation of Ramses hunting the wild bull (Fig. 176) on the walls of this same temple, a relief which, in spite of some bad faults in the drawing, is a composition of much strength and feel- ing, with a notable sense of landscape. A bold and entirely new effort of the time is the representation of the Pharaoh’s naval victory on the Syrian coast (Fig. 173), a relief re- quiring some originality and invention, but too involved for strength and effect. The imitation so evident in the art of Ramses III’s reign is characteristic of the time in all respects. The records of the reign are but weak repetitions of the earlier royal en- comiums, embellished with figures so extremely far-fetched as to be often unintelligible.

Of eleven such ‘‘butlers’’ known to us in the service of Ramses III, five were foreigners in places of power and influence,’ and we shall soon have occasion to observe the prominent role they played at a fatal crisis in his reign. While all was out- wardly splendour and tranquillity and the whole nation was celebrating the king who had saved the Empire, the forces of decay which had for generations been slowly gathering in the state were rapidly reaching the acute stage. An insa- tiable and insidious priesthood commanding enormous wealth, a foreign army ready to serve the master who paid most liberally, and a personal following of alien slaves whose fidelity likewise depended entirely upon the imme- diate gain in view,—these were the factors which Ramses III was constantly forced to manipulate and employ, each against the others. Add to these the host of royal rela- tives and dependents, who were perhaps of all the most dan- gerous element in the situation, and we shall not wonder at the outcome. While the whole situation abounded in unhealthy symp- toms, the first specific instance of the danger inherent in it, which we are able to discern, is the revolt of Ramses’ vizier, who shut himself up in the Delta city of Athribis; but he had miscalculated the power at his command; the 1IV, 419 ff. 32 498 A HISTORY OF EGYPT place was taken by Ramses and the revolt suppressed. Peace and outward tranquility were again restored. As the thirtieth anniversary of the king’s appointment as crown prince approached, elaborate preparations were made for its commemoration. He sent his new vizier, Ta, south- ward in the year twenty nine to collect the processional images of all the gods who participated in a celebration of the usual splendour at Memphis.” Something over a year after this stately commemoration, as the old king was begin- ning to feel his years, a more serious crisis developed. The harem, the source of so many attempts against the throne, was the origin of the trouble. In the early orient there is always among the many mothers of the king’s children a princess or queen who feels that her son has a better claim to the succession than the son of the fortunate rival, who has succeeded in gaining for him the nomination as the king’s successor.

He possessed only the worn and long spent currency of the older dynasties from which he drew whole hymns, songs and lists to be furbished up and made to do service again in perpetuating the glory of a really able and heroic ruler. Perhaps we should not com- plain of the scribe, for the king himself considered it his highest purpose to restore and reproduce the times of Ramses IJ. His own name was made up of the first half of Ramses II’s throne-name, and the second half of his personal name; he named his children and his horses after those of Ramses II, and like him, he was followed on his campaigns by a tame lion who trotted beside his chariot on the march. The achievements of Ramses III were entirely dictated by the circumstances in which he found himself, rather than by any positive tendencies in his own character. But it must be admitted that he was confronted by a situa- tion against which he could have done little even if he had attempted to make head against it. All immediate danger from without had now apparently disappeared, but the nation was slowly declining as a result of decay from within. While Ramses III had shown himself fully able to cope with the assaults from the outside, he did not possess the qualities of virile independence which in some men would have dictated strenuous opposition to the prevailing ten- dencies of the time within the state. This was especially evident in his attitude toward the religious conditions inherited from the Nineteenth Dynasty. We have already pointed out that Setnakht, Ramses III’s father, gained the throne by conciliating the priesthoods, as so many of his successful predecessors had done. Ram- ses III made no effort to shake off the priestly influences with which the crown was thus encumbered.

The treasure rooms of this Medinet Habu temple still stand, and their walls bear testimony to the lavish wealth with which they were filled.* Ramses himself in another record says: ‘‘I filled its treasury with the products of the land of Egypt: gold, silver, every costly stone by the hundred-thousand. Its granary was overflow- ing with barley and wheat; its lands, its herds, their mul- titudes were like the sand of the shore. I taxed for it the Southland as well as the Northland; Nubia and Syria came to it, bearing their impost. It was filled with captives, which thou gavest me among the Nine Bows, and with classes [successive enforced levies], which I created by the ten-thousand. . . .

This is as true of the for- tune of Amon in particular as of the temple wealth in gen- eral. The gift of over seventy miles of Nubian Nile shores (the Dodekaschoinos) to Khnum by Ramses III was but the confirmation by him of an old title; and the enormous -endowments enumerated in the great Papyrus Harris, long supposed to be the gifts of Ramses III, are but inventories of the old sacerdotal estates, in the possession of which the temples are confirmed by him.” These long misunderstood inventories are the source of the above statistics, which reveal to us the situation and they show that it was an inherited situation, created by the prodigal gifts of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties, beginning at least as far back as Thutmose III, who presented three towns in Syria to Amon. By generations of this policy the vast wealth of the temples had gradually been accumulated, and against the insatiable priesthoods long accustomed to the gratification of unlimited exactions, Ramses III was unable, and indeed did not attempt to make a stand.

Yet his treasury must have sorely felt the draughts upon it, with its income gradually shrinking, while the demands upon it in nowise relaxed. Although we know that payments from the government treasury were as slow in ancient, as they have been until recently in modern Kgypt, yet, making all due allowance for this fact, it can hardly be an accident that under the reign of Ramses III we can follow the painful struggles of a band of necrop- olis workmen in their endeavours to secure the monthly fifty sacks of grain due them. Month after month they are obliged to resort to the extremest measures, climbing the necropolis wall and driven by hunger, threatening to storm the very granary itself if food is not given them.

He had a body of temple troops at his command, and as he gathered the sinews of the state into his fingers, gradually gaining control of the treasury, as we have seen, he did not hesitate to measure his strength with the Pharaoh. Naturally no records of such struggles, of the daily friction which must have existed between them, have survived; but a woman giving testimony in a court during the reign of Ramses IX dated a theft in her father’s 1IV, 486-498. 510 A HISTORY OF EGYPT house by telling the court that it happened ‘‘ when the revolt of the High Priest of Amon took place!’’? The state of disorganization and helplessness which was gradually evolving is revealed to us in a chapter from the government of the Theban necropolis, preserved in certain legal archives? of Ramses IX’s reign. Thebes was now rapidly declining; it had been forsaken as a royal residence by the Pharaohs two hundred years before, but it continued to be the burial place of all the royal dead. There had thus been gathered in its necropolis a great mass of wealth in the form of splendid regalia adorning the royal bodies. In the lonely valley behind the western plain, deep in the heart of the cliffs, slept the great emperors, decked in all the magnificence which the wealth of Asia had brought them; and now again, as at the close of the Kighteenth Dynasty, their degenerate descendants, far from maintain- ing the empire which they had once won, were not even able to protect their bodies from destruction. In the sixteenth year of Ramses [X’s reign the royal tombs of the plain before the western cliffs were found to have been attacked; one of them, that of Sebekemsaf,* of the Thirteenth Dynasty, had been robbed of all its mortuary furniture and his royal body and that of his queen violated for the sake of their costly ornaments. Although the authors of this deed were captured and prosecuted, the investigation shows sinister traces that the officials engaged in it were not altogether dis- interested. Three years later, when Ramses IX had made his son, Ramses X, coregent with himself, six men were con- victed of robbing the tombs of Seti I and Ramses IJ, show- ing that the emboldened robbers had now left the plain and entered the cliff tombs of the valley behind.

The flaccid character of the judges and the dan- gerous persistence of the accused is shown by a remarkable incident which now followed the appointment of the court. Some of the women conspirators, led by the general, Peyes, gained such influence over the bailiffs in charge of the pris- oners that they went with Peyes and the women to the houses of two of the judges, who, with amazing indiscretion, received and caroused with them. The two indiscreet judges, with one of their colleagues, who was really inno- cent, and the two bailiffs, were immediately put on trial.

At this juncture the king’s party gained full information of the conspiracy, the attempt on the king’s life was foiled, the plans for revolt were checkmated, and the people involved in the treason were all seized. The old Pharaoh, sorely shaken by the ordeal, and possibly suffering bodily injury from the attempted assassination, immediately appointed a special court for the trial of the conspirators. The very words of the commission empowering this court indicate his probable consciousness that he would not long survive the shock, while at the same time they lay upon the judges a responsibility for impartial justice on the merits of the case, with a judicial objectivity which is remarkable in one who held the lives of the accused in his unchallenged power and had himself just been the victim of a murderous assault at their hands.

The state of disorganization and helplessness which was gradually evolving is revealed to us in a chapter from the government of the Theban necropolis, preserved in certain legal archives? of Ramses IX’s reign. Thebes was now rapidly declining; it had been forsaken as a royal residence by the Pharaohs two hundred years before, but it continued to be the burial place of all the royal dead. There had thus been gathered in its necropolis a great mass of wealth in the form of splendid regalia adorning the royal bodies. In the lonely valley behind the western plain, deep in the heart of the cliffs, slept the great emperors, decked in all the magnificence which the wealth of Asia had brought them; and now again, as at the close of the Kighteenth Dynasty, their degenerate descendants, far from maintain- ing the empire which they had once won, were not even able to protect their bodies from destruction. In the sixteenth year of Ramses [X’s reign the royal tombs of the plain before the western cliffs were found to have been attacked; one of them, that of Sebekemsaf,* of the Thirteenth Dynasty, had been robbed of all its mortuary furniture and his royal body and that of his queen violated for the sake of their costly ornaments. Although the authors of this deed were captured and prosecuted, the investigation shows sinister traces that the officials engaged in it were not altogether dis- interested. Three years later, when Ramses IX had made his son, Ramses X, coregent with himself, six men were con- victed of robbing the tombs of Seti I and Ramses IJ, show- ing that the emboldened robbers had now left the plain and entered the cliff tombs of the valley behind.

In his tenth year Ramses IX summoned Amenhotep to the great forecourt of the Amon-temple, where in the presence of the High Priest’s political associates and supporters, the king presented him with a gorgeous array of gold and silver \"IV, 474-483. 21V, 414-15. 3IV, 486 ff 2IV, 488 ff.

The days when such distinctions were the reward of valour on the battle fields of Syria are long passed; and skill in priest-craft is the surest guarantee of preferment. As the king delivered the rich gifts to the High Priest he accom- panied them with words of praise such that one is in doubt whether they are delivered by the soverign to the subject or by the subject to his lord. At the same time he informs Amenhotep that certain revenues formerly paid to the Pharaoh shall now be rendered to the treasury of Amon, and although the king’s words are not entirely clear it would seem that all revenues levied by the king’s treasury but later intended for the treasury of the god, shall now be collected directly by the scribes of the temple, thus putting the temple to a certain extent in the place of the state. All these honours were twice recorded by Amenhotep, together with a record of his buildings on the walls of the Karnak temple.t Both the records of his gifts and honours are ac- companied each by a large relief (Fig. 177) showing Amen- hotep receiving his gifts from the king, and depicting his figure in the same heroic stature as that of the king,—an unprecedented liberty, to which no official had ever before in the history of Egypt dared to presume. In all such scenes from time immemorial the official appearing before the king had been represented as a pigmy before the tower- ing figure of the Pharaoh; but the High Priest of Amon was now rapidly growing to measure his stature with that of the Pharaoh himself, both on the temple wall and in the affairs of government.

We can hardly wonder that the image of ‘‘Amon-of-the-Way’’ failed to impress Zakar-Baal, as the Pharaoh’s armies had impressed his ancestors; and it was only when Wenamon’s messenger to Egypt returned with a few vessels of silver and gold, some fine linen, papyrus rolls, ox-hides, coils of cordage, and the like, that the Phcenician ruler ordered his men to cut the desired logs; although he had sent some of the heavier timbers for the hull of the barge in advance, as an evidence of his good faith. As Wenamon was about to depart with his timber, some eight months after he had left Thebes, Zakar-Baal tells him with grim humour of the fate of the Egyptian envoys of a former reign who had been detained seventeen years and had ultimately died in Byblos. He even offers to have Wenamon taken and shown their tombs. This privilege the frightened envoy declines, adding that the embassy which had been so treated was one of merely human envoys, while Zakar-Baal was now honoured with an unparalleled distinction in receiving the god himself! Promising the prince the payment of the balance due him, Wenamon proceeded to embark, when he discovered in the offing a fleet of eleven Thekel ships, coming with instruc- tions to arrest him, doubtless for the seizure of the silver which he had taken from the Thekel on the voyage from Tyre to Byblos. The unhappy Wenamon now lost all hope, and throwing himself down upon the shore burst into weep- ing. Even Zakar-Baal was touched by his misery and sent to him a reassuring message, with food and wine and an Egyptian chanteuse. The next day the prince succeeded in holding the Thekel of the fleet to an interview, while Wenamon embarked and escaped.

Like the shadowy caliph, whom the Egyptian sultans brought from Bagdad to Cairo, and maintained for a time there, so the unfortunate Ramses XII had been brought from his Delta residence to Thebes, that the conventionalities of the old Pharaonic tradition might still be continued for a brief time. A letter written to his Nubian viceroy in his seventeenth year shows that he still retained some voice there up to that time at least ;? but the door (Fig. 183), bearing the two reliefs just mentioned, shows him deprived of his authority there also, for it bears an inscription of Hrihor, still dated under Ramses XII (the year is unfortunately broken out), in which the High Priest appears as ‘‘viceroy of Kush.’’? Already at the close of the Nineteenth Dynasty we recall that Amon had gained possession of the Nubian gold-country ;* the High Priest has now gone a step further and seized the whole of the great province of the Upper Nile. The same inscription calls him also ‘‘overseer of the double granary,’’ who, as grain was always Egypt’s chief source of wealth, was the most impor- tant fiscal officer in the state, next the chief treasurer himself.

Stopping at Dor on the voyage out, Wenamon was robbed of the little money he had, and was unable to secure any satisfaction from the Thekel prince of that city. After waiting in despair for nine days, he departed for Byblos by way of Tyre, having on the way somehow succeeded in seizing from certain Thekel people a bag of silver as security for his loss at Dor. He finally arrived in safety at Byblos, where Zakar-Baal, the prince of the city, would not even receive him, but ordered him to leave. Such was the state of an Hgyptian envoy in Phenicia, within fifty or sixty years of the death of Ramses III.

All wills and property conveyances of members of the High Priest’s family were oracles of Amon,! and civil documents thus became divine decrees. Banished political exiles were recalled by oracle of the god, criminal cases were tried before him, and by his decision the convicted were put to death. In the case of a temple official, undoubtedly a favourite of the High Priest, two documents were placed before the god, one declaring the accused guilty of embez- zlement of temple income, and the other declaring him inno- cent. The god seized the latter document, thus determining the innocence of the accused.?. Priestly jugglery, ruling if necessary in utter disregard of law and justice, thus enabled the High Priest to cloak with the divine sanction all that he wished to effect. Hrihor must have been an old man at his accession (1090 B. C.). He did not long survive Ramses XII, and at his death his son, Payonekh, also advanced in years, was unable to maintain the independence of Thebes against Nesube- nebded at Tanis, who extended his authority over the whole country for a brief time.

He beautified Bubastis, his Delta residence, and at Thebes undertook a vast enlargement of the Karnak temple. His son Yewepet, who was High Priest of Amon there, dis- patched an expedition to Silsileh to secure the stone for an enormous court and pylon which were to complete the Kar- nak temple on the west and give it a magnificent front toward the river. The side walls and colonnades of the court had been planned and erected at some time after the Nineteenth Dynasty, but the pylon was still lacking. It was, and is today, the largest temple court in existence, being over three hundred and fourteen feet wide by two hundred and sixty nine feet deep, fronted by the largest pylon in Egypt, thirty six feet thick, one hundred and fifty feet high and with a front of three hundred and fifty seven feet (Map 11). Sheshonk intended that it should be used at the celebration of his thirty years’ jubilee; whether it was ever so used we do not know; but he never lived to see it com- pleted, and the builder’s scaffolding and ramps of sun-dried brick still cumber the walls beneath the debris of many cen- turies. Part of its decoration was however completed, and by the south gate, now known as the Bubastite Portal, the Pharaoh had executed a huge relief in the old style, depict- ing himself smiting the Asiatics before Amon, who, to- gether with the presiding goddess of Thebes, leads and pre- sents to Sheshonk ten lines of captives, containing one hun- dred and fifty six Palestinian prisoners, each symbolizing a town or locality captured by Sheshonk and bearing its name.

One of these Delta lords, named Pedibast, who had cast off the suzerainty of the Bubastites, gained the dominant position among his rivals at the death of Sheshonk IV, and founded a new house known to Manetho as the Twenty Third Dynasty. Manetho places this dynasty at Tanis, but, as Pedibast’s name shows, he was of Bubastite origin, like the family which he unseated, and as we shall later see, his suc- cessor ruled at Bubastis. Pedibast gained Thebes and held it until his twenty third year, although from his fourteenth year he was obliged to share its control with king Yewepet, a dynast of the eastern Delta.1 A late Demotic papyrus in Vienna contains a folk-tale which significantly reveals the unsettled conditions of the time among the turbulent dynasts, whom, like Yewepet, Pedibast was unable to control. It narrates the course of a long and serious feud between Kaamenhotep, the dynast of Mendes in the Delta, and Pemou, the mercenary commander in Heliopolis. The occa- sion of the quarrel is the seizure of a valuable coat-of-mail by Kaamenhotep, and Pedibast is unable to prevent wide- spread hostilities among the Delta dynasts, as they pro- 1 IV, 794, 878, No. 2. 536 A HISTORY OF EGYPT nounce for one or the other of the contending principals.’ Under Pedibast’s successor, Osorkon III, the power of the dominant house rapidly waned until there was at last an independent lord or petty king in every city of the Delta and up the river as far as Hermopolis.

The hopeless state of the country was clearly understood by the sagacious Isaiah, who declared to his people: ‘‘ Behold the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud and cometh unto Egypt; and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it. And I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians; and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city and kingdom against king- dom. ... And I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the Lord of Hosts. . . . The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish; the counsel of the wisest counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish.... The princes of Zoan [Tanis] are become fools, the princes of Noph [Napata?] are deceived; they have caused Egypt to go astray that are the corner stone of her tribes. The Lord hath mingled a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her; they have caused Egypt to go astray in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggering in his vomit. Neither shall there be for Kgypt any work which head or tail, palm-branch or rush, may do.’ No truer picture could possibly be portrayed. In spite of these unfavourable conditions, one important element of culture in Egypt was inspired with new life. As in the turbulent age of the Medicis, Italy, and especially Florence, enjoyed an artistic transformation, in which works of the highest genius were produced with an amazing fecun- dity; as in Cairo under the constant revolutions, assassina- tions, usurpations and incessant oppression of the Mam- lukes, while the land was economically going to ruin, the mosque form was developed, perfected and the noblest monu- ments of Saracen architecture were erected; so now under similar seemingly adverse influences the sculptors of Egypt were slowly ushering in a new era in the history of art and feeling impulses which we shall find attaining their highest fruition in the Restoration which was to follow after an- other half century of foreign aggression and political decay. 1Isaiah, 19.

Meantime those profound political changes, fraught with the greatest danger to Egypt, which the reader has fore- seen, were taking place in Asia. The powerful military state on the Tigris had for centuries been seeking to estab- lish itself as the dominant power in western Asia. As far back as 1100 B. C. Nesubenebded, the first of the Tanites, had sent a gift to Tiglath Pileser I on his appearance in the west; and two hundred and fifty years later the Pharaoh had contributed a quota to the western alliance which had hoped to break the power of Shalmaneser II at Qarqar in 854 B. C. Rousing Assyria from a period of temporary decadence, Tiglath-pileser III had brought her full power to bear upon the West, and in 734 to 732 B. C. had ravaged Syria-Palestine to the very borders of Egypt. The Ara- mean kingdom of Damascus fell and the whole west was organized as dependencies of Assyria.

His reign is parallel with the last years of the Twenty Third Dynasty, which seems to have struggled on at Bubastis as vassal princes under him. It is evident that Tefnakhte was of a type far superior to the ordinary Delta dynast; he must have greatly increased the power and prestige of Sais, for his son Bocchoris, on succeeding to his father’s throne, was later regarded as the founder of the Twenty Fourth Dynasty. In Upper Egypt Piankhi’s rule continued for a brief period. He con- trolled Thebes long enough to do some slight building in the temple of Mut, where he left a relief representing a festal voyage of his ships, perhaps his return from the North; for among the vessels appears the state barge of Sais, captured from Tefnakhte’s fleet in the northern war. Piankhi was then still in control as far north as Heracle- opolis, whose commandant appears in the relief as admiral of the Nubian fleet.1_ In order to gain control of the fortune of Amon with an appearance of legitimacy, Piankhi caused his sister-wife, Amenardis, to be adopted by Shepnupet, the daughter of Osorkon III, who was sacerdotal princess of Thebes.?, The device was probably not new. But as Piankhi withdrew the decadent Twenty Third Dynasty put forth its last expiring effort and established an ephemeral au- thority in Thebes, where Osorkon III seems to have ruled for a short time as coregent with an otherwise unknown Takelot, the third of the name. Piankhi’s invasion of Egypt and entire reign there seem therefore to have fallen within the reign of Osorkon III. But the rising power of Sais soon overwhelmed the failing Bubastites, and, as we have noted, Bocchoris, son of Tefnakhte of Sais, gained the throne of Lower Egypt probably about 718 B.

When his Delta vassals had paid Piankhi a last visit he loaded his ships with the wealth of the North and sailed away for his southern capital amid the acclamations of the people. If we have devoted an apparently disproportionate amount of space to the campaign which was now concluded it is because it displays to us more clearly than ever before or after, the conditions which always arose in Egypt when- ever any weakening of the central power betrayed to the local dynasts that they might without danger assume their independence or even gradually usurp the crown of the Pharaoh. Arrived at Napata, Piankhi erected in the temple of Amon amagnificent granite stela,! inscribed on all four sides, recording in detail the entire campaign, in which he, the son of Amon, had humiliated the rivals of that god in the North. With the possible exception of the Annals of Thut- mose III and the documents of Ramses II on the battle of Kadesh, this remarkable literary monument is the clearest and most rational account of a military expedition which has survived from ancient Egypt. It displays literary skill and an appreciation of dramatic situations which is notable, while the vivacious touches found here and there quite re- lieve it of the arid tone usual in such hieroglyphic docu- ments. The imagination endues the personages appearing here more easily with life than those of any other similar historical narrative of Egypt; and the humane Piankhi es- pecially, the lover of horses, remains a man far removed from the conventional companion and equal of the gods who inevitably occupies the exalted throne of the Pharaohs in all other such records.

Then taking command in person, he rapidly ranged the captured craft together with his own fleet along the eastern walls, thus furnishing footing for his assaulting lines, which he immediately sent over the ram- parts and captured the city before its eastern defenses could be strengthened against him. A great slaughter now ensued, but all sanctuaries were respected and protected, and Ptah of course repudiated Tefnakhte and recognized Piankhi as king. The entire region of Memphis then submitted, whereupon the Delta dynasts also appeared in numbers with gifts for Piankhi and signified their submission. After dividing the . wealth of Memphis between the treasuries of Amon and Ptah, Piankhi crossed the river, worshipped in the ancient. sanctuary of Khereha-Babylon, and followed the old sacred road thence to Heliopolis, where he camped by the harbour. His annals narrate at length how he entered the holy of holies of the sun-god here,that he might be recognized as his son and heir to the throne of Hgypt, according to custom usual since the remote days of the Fifth Dynasty. Here king Osorkon III of the Twenty Third Dynasty at Bubastis, now but a petty dynast like the rest, visited Piankhi and recognized the Nubian’s suzerainty. Having then moved his camp to a point just east of Athribis, by a town called Keheni, Piankhi there received the submission of the Delta lords. Of these there were fifteen: being two kings, the said Osorkon III, who was still with him, and king Yewepet of Tentremu in the eastern Delta, who had once shared Thebes with Pedibast, Osorkon III’s predecessor; nine princes, wha governed Mendes, Sebennytos, Saft el-Henneh, Busiria 544 A ‘HISTORY OF EGYPT Hesebka (the eleventh nome), Phagroriopolis, Khereha- Babylon, and other towns of the Delta and vicinity which cannot be identified with certainty; and finally a mercenary commander in Hermopolis Parva, son of the prince of Mendes, besides a priest of Horus who had founded a sacer- dotal principality at Letopolis, like that of the priests at Heracleopolis, from whom the Twenty Second Dynasty sprang.

About 700 B. C., having reigned probably twelve years in Egypt, although he may have ruled over Nubia for some years before his advent in Egypt, Shabaka was succeeded by Shabataka, another Ethiopian, whose connection with the reigning Ethiopian or Nubian family is a little uncertain, although Manetho, who calls him Sebichos, makes him a sor 1UI Kings, 18: 21. 2 See p. 357. STV, 886, 880: 554 A HISTORY OF EGYPT of Shabaka. As the western vassals remained quiet and Sennacherib was now absorbed in his operations at the other extremity of his empire, Shabataka was unmolested by the Assyrian. His name is rare in Egypt, but it is evident from the conditions which survived him that he was entirely unable to exterminate the local dynasts and consolidate the power of Egypt for the supreme struggle which was before her. It was indeed now patent that the Ethiopians were quite unfitted for the imperial task before them. The southern strain with which their blood was tinctured began to appear as the reign of Shabataka drew to a close about 688 B. C. It is at this juncture that we can trace the rising fortunes of prince Taharka, a son of Piankhi, who had gone north from Napata as a youth of only twenty years with a king whose name is unfortunately lost, who nevertheless must have been Shabaka.' He was the son of a Nubian woman and his features, as preserved in contemporary sculptures, show unmistakable negroid characteristics. A son of the great Piankhi, he played a prominent role, and as we have seen, he was entrusted with the command of the army in the campaign against Sennacherib. We know nothing of the circumstances which brought about his advent to the throne, but Manetho states, that leading an army from Ethiopia he slew Sebichos, who must be Shabataka, and seized the crown.

In 720 B. C. Sargon again appeared in the west to suppress a revolt in which Hgypt doubtless had a hand. Completely victorious in the north, he marched southward to Raphia, where he totally defeated the allies of the south, among whom Egypt had a levy of troops under a commander named §Sib’1.\"’. The Assyrian hosts had now twice swept down to the very borders of Egypt and the dynasts must by this time have been fully aware of their danger. Probably nothing but the tradi- tional reputation of Egypt, the memory of the old days when she had been supreme in Asia, and Ninevite kings had sought her friendship with gifts, kept Tiglath Pileser IIT and Sargon from invading her frontier and discovering how lamentably weak she was. The situation was now reversed; in 715 B. C. Sargon’s records report the reception of gifts from Pir’u (Pharaoh) of Egypt,? who will probably have been Bocchoris. Such was the threatening situation of Egypt when, prob- ably about 711 B. C., after an interval of some ten years since the retirement of Piankhi, the Nubian kings again appeared in the North. Piankhi had now been succeeded by his brother, Shabaka, with whom the uninterrupted series of pure Ethiopian royal names begins. He had married Piankhi’s daughter*? and of course based his claim to the throne, as in Egypt, not only upon his own birth, but also upon this alliance. We possess no native records of his conquest of the country, but Manetho states that he burned Bocchoris alive.

Re- membering the ancient supremacy of Egypt, failing to un- derstand the state of decadent impotence into which she had fallen, and anxious to shake off the oppressive Assyrian yoke, they lent a ready ear to the emissaries of Shabaka. Only in Judah did the prophet-statesman Isaiah foresee the futility of depending upon Egypt, and the final catastrophe which should overtake her at the hands of Assyria. The vigilant Assyrian, however, hearing of the projected alli- ance, acted so quickly that the conspirators were glad to drop their designs and protest fidelity. In spite of diffi- culties in Babylon and rebellions in the north, the able and aggressive Sargon pushed the consolidation of his power with brilliant success and left to his son Sennacherib in 705 B. C. the first stable and firmly compacted empire ever founded by a Semitic power. Sennacherib was embarrassed in his earlier years with the usual complications in Babylon. Mardukbaliddin, an able and active claimant of the Babylonian throne, who had already caused Sennacherib’s father much trouble, now sent his emissaries to stir up defection and create a diver- sion in his favour in the west. Asa result Luli, the energetic king of Tyre, Hezekiah of Judah, the dynasts of Edom, Moab and Ammon, with the chiefs of their Beduin neigh- bours, in fact, all the southern half of the Assyrian con- quests in the west besides Egypt were finally organized in a great alliance against Ninevah. Before the allies could act in concert, Sennacherib suddenly appeared in the west, marched down the Pheenician coast, capturing all its strong- holds save Tyre; and pressed on southward to the revolting Philistine cities. Here having punished Askalon, he ad- vanced to Altaqu, where he came upon the motley army gathered by the tardy Shabaka among his northern vassals, whom Sennacherib calls ‘‘the kings of Musri’’ (Egypt).", "question": "What was Pharaoh Shabaka's foreign policy towards the Syro-Palestinian states, and which specific states did he target?", "answer": "Shabaka, appreciating the danger of Assyria, immediately sent agents to Syro-Palestinian states like Philistia, Judah, Moab, and Edom to incite them to revolt against their Ninevite suzerain."}

For some thirteen years Taharka ruled his kingdom with- out molestation from Asia. Meantime he was able to exe- eute buildings of minor importance in Tanis and Memphis, 1IV, 892, 895. 2IV, 892-6.

The west had for twenty years seen nothing of Sennacherib, who was now assassinated by his sons, in 681 B. C. As soon as his son, Esarhaddon, could arrange the affairs of the great empire to which he had suc- eeeded, he determined to resort to the only possible remedy for the constant interference of Egypt with the authority of Assyria in Palestine, viz., the conquest of the Nile coun- try and humiliation of the Pharaoh. With farseeing thor- oughness, he laid his plans for the execution of this pur- pose, and his army was knocking at the frontier fortresses of the eastern Delta in 674 B. C1. But Taharka, who was a man of far greater ability than his two predecessors on the throne, must have made a supreme effort to meet the crisis. The outcome of the battle (673 B. C.) was unfavour- able for the Assyrian if, as the documents perhaps indicate, he did not suffer positive defeat. But Hsarhaddon never- theless quietly continued his preparations for the conquest of Egypt. Baal, king of Tyre, perhaps encouraged by the undecisive result of the first Assyrian invasion, then rebelled, making common cause with Taharka. In 670 B. C. Esar- haddon was again in the West at the head of his forces. Having invested Tyre, he was aided in his march across the desert to the Delta by the native Beduin, whose camel-car- avans furnished him with water.

We also find records of his temple restorations at Thebes,® and it is evident that he governed Egypt at least in his relations with the temples, precisely as a native Pharaoh would have done. His sister, Amenar- dis, seems to have actually ruled Thebes with a large degree of independence, and in spite of his partiality to the priests, it was probably Shabaka who broke the power of the High Priest of Amon, of whose impotence we shall see further evidence as we proceed. About 700 B. C., having reigned probably twelve years in Egypt, although he may have ruled over Nubia for some years before his advent in Egypt, Shabaka was succeeded by Shabataka, another Ethiopian, whose connection with the reigning Ethiopian or Nubian family is a little uncertain, although Manetho, who calls him Sebichos, makes him a sor 1UI Kings, 18: 21. 2 See p. 357.

As the western vassals remained quiet and Sennacherib was now absorbed in his operations at the other extremity of his empire, Shabataka was unmolested by the Assyrian. His name is rare in Egypt, but it is evident from the conditions which survived him that he was entirely unable to exterminate the local dynasts and consolidate the power of Egypt for the supreme struggle which was before her. It was indeed now patent that the Ethiopians were quite unfitted for the imperial task before them. The southern strain with which their blood was tinctured began to appear as the reign of Shabataka drew to a close about 688 B. C. It is at this juncture that we can trace the rising fortunes of prince Taharka, a son of Piankhi, who had gone north from Napata as a youth of only twenty years with a king whose name is unfortunately lost, who nevertheless must have been Shabaka.' He was the son of a Nubian woman and his features, as preserved in contemporary sculptures, show unmistakable negroid characteristics. A son of the great Piankhi, he played a prominent role, and as we have seen, he was entrusted with the command of the army in the campaign against Sennacherib.

While the earlier kings had built up and beautified Napata, their successors were obliged to move the royal residence up the river. The first impulse toward this change was doubtless due to the campaign of Psamtik II against lower Nubia early in the sixth century. In any case at this time the kingdom began to expand southward. The rich lands on the Blue Nile of which the most important district was known to the Arab geographers as Aloa, were added to the kingdom. Napata was separated from all this by the upper cataracts. As trade connections with the south were established and new acquisitions there developed more fully the royal residence was transferred above the cataracts, and by 560 B. C. the Nubian kings were occupying their new capi- tal, known to the Greeks as Meroe. Apart from other con- siderations, the wisdom of thus placing the difficult cataract region between the capital and invaders from the north was shown by the discomfiture of Cambyses’ expedition against Nubia at the hands of its king Nastesen in 525 B. C. As the nation shifted southward it was completely with- drawn from contact with the northern world; and Ethiopia gradually lost behind a mist of legend, became the wonder- land celebrated in Greek story as the source of civilization. The Egyptian language and hieroglyphics, which the kings had hitherto used for their records, now slowly disappeared, and by the beginning of our era the native language was finally written in a script which as yet is undeciphered. When a century or two after the Roman conquest the Hthi- opian kingdom slowly collapsed and fell to pieces, its north- ern districts were absorbed by wild hordes of the Blemmyes who pushed in from the east; while in the south it was suc- ceeded by the Christian kingdom of Abyssinia, which rose at the sources of the Blue Nile in the fourth century A.

Seen through the mist of over a thousand years, what was to them ancient Egypt was endowed with the ideal perfection of the divine regime which had preceded it. The worship of the kings who had ruled at Memphis in those remote days was revived and the ritual of their mortuary service maintained and en- dowed. Their pyramids were even extensively restored and repaired. The archaic titles and the long array of dignities worn by the lords at the court and in the government of the pyramid-builders were again brought into requisition, and in the externals of government everything possible was done to clothe it with the appearance of remote antiquity. The writing of the time was also given an archaic colour on for- mal and official monuments, and its antique forms must have cost the Saite scribes long and weary study.

The Book of the Dead, which now received its last redaction, becominga roll sixty feet long, shows plain traces of the revival of this. ancient mortuary literature. In the tomb-chapels we find again the fresh and pleasing pictures from the life of the people in marsh and meadow, in work- shop and ship-yard.

C. the great king’s army drove the Ethiopian for the last time from Lower Egypt. The Assyrians pursued him to Thebes, and as he ingloriously withdrew southward, they sacked and plundered the magnificent capital of Kgypt’s days of splen- dour. The rich cultus images, the gorgeous ritual furniture and implements, with which the pious Theban prince, Men- temhet, had equipped the temples, fell a prey to the fierce Assyrian soldiery, while ‘‘two enormous obelisks, wrought of bright silver, whose weight was 2,500 talents, the adornment of a temple-door,’’ which they carried off to Ninevah, indi- cate the wealth still remaining in the temples of the long de- vastated nation.?

Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.

It entered upon the long centuries of lingering decay which have left it at the present day still the mightiest ruin surviving from the ancient world (Fig. 183). The retirement of Tanutamon to Napata was the termi- nation of Ethiopian supremacy in Egypt. His whole career was characteristic of the feeble and inglorious line from which he sprang. Emerging from the remote reaches of the upper Nile, the Ethiopians had attempted an imperial role and aspired to intervene in the international polities of western Asia.

As a concession to this class his body-guard contained a thousand men from each of the two classes, the Hermotybies and Calasyries; but he will have had many more of his hardy Greeks and Carians at his hand on all occasions. The prosperous and powerful Egypt which was now emerging from the long Decadence was totally different from the Egypt of any earlier renascence. It was impos- sible again to rouse the nation to arms as in the days when the Hyksos were expelled; it was therefore inevitably the deliberate policy of Psamtik I, while expending every effort to put the nation on a sound economic basis, at the same time to depend upon foreign soldiery for the military power indispensable to an oriental ruler. His necessarily con- stant care was to transmute the economic prosperity of the land into military power. In a word, the wealth of the land must nourish and maintain a formidable army, even though the effective portion of this army might be aliens. This was an evil which Psamtik was powerless to alter. In such a state the conservation of the productive capacities of the 570 ANEHISTORY) OF EGYPT nation is as important as, or we may better say, indispen- sable to, tae maintenance of the army. Neither can live without the other. In this respect Psamtik I was confronted by the same problem which faced Omar and the early Ca: liphs. A revival under such conditions as these is due al- most solely to the personal initiative of the sovereign who manipulates the available forces: those of power and those of industry; so employing them all in harmonious interac- tion that prosperity and effective power result. Psamtik was himself the motive and creative power, while the people were but given the opportunity to fulfil their proper func- tions and to move freely in their wonted channels. There was no longer any great relative vitality in the nation (and here Psamtik’s task differed strikingly from that of the early Caliphs), and the return of ordered government and consequent prosperity enabled them to indulge the ten- dency to retrospect already observable in the Twenty Third Dynasty.

The nation was at last rescued from the un- stable rule of a body of feudal lords and their turbulent mili- tary adherents, under whose irresponsible tyranny it had suf- fered, with but brief respites, for some four hundred years. This remarkable achievement of Psamtik I places him among the ablest rulers who ever sat on the throne of the Pharaohs. Indeed the conditions by which he was confronted were so ad- verse, and the evils with which he was obliged to cope were so old, persistent and deeply rooted that his success should perhaps rank him higher than either Amenemhet I, the founder of the Twelfth Dynasty, or Ahmose I, the con- queror of the Hyksos. He was not, however, able completely to exterminate the dynasts, as is commonly stated.

At Thebes Men- temhet remained as prince and ‘‘governor of the South’’;} and in Heracleopolis, the other principality of Upper Egypt, we find prince Hor, with the rank of a general, building a temple in his own name at least a generation after Psamtik I’s time.” Such an enormous tomb as that of Pediamenem- opet at Thebes could only have been excavated by a noble of immense wealth and extensive power. It is to be noticed, however, that at Thebes Mentemhet is called upon to make liberal contributions to the revenues of Nitocris, Psamtik’s daughter ;? and what is still more important, he was not succeeded by his eldest son Nesuptah, but by one Pedihor, who gained the titles, ‘‘prince of Thebes and governor of the South.’’* It was perhaps Psamtik I’s policy to with- draw from the feudal lords their rights of inheritance and thus to rid himself of them as an hereditary class. Enjoy- ing certain privileges, some of the old dynasts therefore still survived, but the strong and skilful hand of Psamtik held them firmly in check, as in the days of the early Middle Kingdom under Amenemhet I. They no longer endangered the unity of the nation. A not less troublesome problem was the organization of the military class. The now completely Egyptianized Libyans who had lived in Egypt for centuries had finally de- veloped into a warrior-class of no great effectiveness, whose numbers at this time, absurdly exaggerated by Herodotus, we cannot determine.", "question": "Did Psamtik I completely eliminate all the local dynasts?", "answer": "No, he was not able to completely exterminate them; some survived by espousing his cause and thus gained immunity."}

Thus the real char- acter of the Egyptian and his civilization was never cor- rectly understood by the Greeks, and their writings regard- ing the Nile country, even though often ridiculing its strange THE RESTORATION 579 customs, have transmitted to us a false impression as to the value especially of its intellectual achievements. The Greek, with his insatiable thirst for the truth, and his con- stant attitude of healthy inquiry, was vastly superior, I need hardly say, to the Egyptian, whose reputed wisdom he so venerated. Under these circumstances it was only the later political history of the country, the course of which came under their own immediate observation, with which the Greeks were familiar. From the time of Psamtik I we possess a fund of popular Greek tradition regarding the Twenty Sixth Dynasty, which, if properly used, throws an invaluable light upon a time when native records and monu- ments, located as they were in the exposed Delta, have almost entirely perished. Before the impact of the foreign life, which thus flowed in upon Egypt, the Egyptian showed himself entirely unmoved, and held himself aloof, fortified behind his cere- monial purity and his inviolable reserve. If he could have had his way he would have banished the foreigners one and all from his shores; under the circumstances, like the modern Chinese, he trafficked with them and was reconciled to their presence by the gain they brought him. Thus while the Saitic Pharaohs, as we shall further see, were profoundly influenced by the character of the Greeks, the mass of the Kigyptians were unscathed by it. On the other hand, the Greeks must have profited much by the intercourse with Nile valley civilization, although it will have been chiefly material profit which they gained. They found there, per- fected and ready at hand, the technical processes, which their unique genius was so singularly able to apply to the realization of higher ends than those governing the older civilizations. They certainly borrowed artistic forms in plenty, and the artistic influences from the Nile, which had been felt in the Mycenexan centres of civilizations as far back at least as the Twelfth Dynasty (2000 B.

{"context": "I refer to the artistic capacity of the people. This always fruitful element of their culture was now a marked exception to the lifeless lack of initiative displayed in all other functions of life. Here their creative vitality, already revived in the Ethiopian period, was still unblighted and their artistic sense was keenly alive to the new possi- bilities open to them under the new order. We have seen that the Restoration in religion demanded the revival of the old subjects in the tomb-chapel reliefs, and in spite of the likeness of these copies to their ancient models, more than a superficial examination invariably discloses a dis- tinct character and manner peculiarly their own. There is . just that touch of freedom which the art of the Old King- dom lacked, and a soft beauty in their sinuous and sweeping lines which adds an indescribable grace to the reliefs of the Saitie school. If this tendency be sometimes extreme to the point of effeminacy, it is compensated for by the quali- ties which the new freedom brought with it. While the old canons and conventionalities still prevailed in general, there was now and then an artist who could shake them off and place the human body in relief with the shoulders drawn in proper relations and freed from the distortion of the Old Kingdom. It was this freedom and ability to see things as they are which led to a school of portraiture far surpassing the best work of the Old Kingdom. Among the Saitic mor- tuary reliefs the conventional heads prescribed by the Old Kingdom canons are still almost invariable; but the artist could now and then insert a portrait of such marked indi- viduality as to stand out in sharp contrast with the uni- formity of the neighbouring heads. Portraits of the same THE RESTORATION 573 character appear also in the round (ig. 186), displaying a study of the bony conformation of the skull, the folds and wrinkles of the skin, in fine a mastery of the entire anatomical development and a grasp of individual character such as no early art had yet achieved.

Industrial art flourished as never before and the Egyptian craftsman was rarely rivalled. In fayence the manufactories of the time were especially suc- cessful and prolific, and the museum collections are filled with works of this period. The architecture of the time has, alas, perished, and if we may judge from the achievements of the Saitic sculptor, we have in this respect suffered irreparable loss; for it is probable that we owe the origin of the rich and beautiful columns of Ptolemaic temples to the Saite architect. While the material products of art offered visual evidence of marked divergence from the ancient prototype which it was supposed to follow, such incongruities in the organiza- tion of the government, while not less real, were probably not so evident. From the few surviving monuments of the period the real character of the state is not clearly deter- minable. Geographically the Delta had forever become the dominant region. The development of commerce with the northern world and related political reasons had made this northward shift inevitable and permanent. Psamtik and his descendants lived in their native Sais, which now became a great and splendid city, adorned with temples and palaces.

This impression could only be deep- ened by the marvels with which the land was filled: the enormous buildings and temples, whose construction was often a mystery to him; the mystic writing which covered their walls; the strange river, unlike any he had ever seen; the remarkable religion, whose mysterious ritual seemed to him the cloak for the most profound truths; the unquestion- ably vast antiquity of countless impressive monuments all about him; all this, where an unprejudiced, objective study of the people and their history was impossible, inevitably blinded even the Greek of the highest intelligence and cul- ture, who now visited the country.", "question": "Why did a class of interpreters emerge in Egypt during this period to assist Greeks?", "answer": "A class of interpreters arose because the Greeks never learned to read Egyptian writing sufficiently well to understand its records or ancient history."}

Relations with the Greeks continued on the old friendly basis and Herodotus relates how the Eleans sent a delegation to Psamtik II to obtain his judg- ment on the fairness of their management of the Olympian games. At home he continued the Saitic control of Thebes by arranging for the adoption of his daughter, EKnekhnes- nefribre, by his aged aunt, the daughter of Psamtik I, Nitocris, who still survived as Divine Votress or sacerdotal 586 A HISTORY OF EGYPT princess of Thebes.

She con- tinued in control of Thebes until the advent of the Persians nearly seventy years later.! Meanwhile the Saites were still casting longing eyes upon the ancient dominions of Egypt in Asia, and when Apries (the Ha‘abre‘ of the Egyptians, or Hophra‘ of the Hebrews) succeeded his father Psamtik IT early in 588 B. C., he imme- diately resumed the old designs of his house to recover them. Already under Necho, in 597 B. C., as we have seen, Nebu- chadrezzar had been obliged to advance on Jerusalem in consequence of the rebellion of Jehoiachin, an event in which Necho may have secretly had a hand. The next year the unhappy city capitulated, and some nine or ten thousand of the better class were deported to Babylonia, leaving only ‘the poorest sort of the people of the land.’’? Jehoichin’s uncle, Zedekiah, was appointed by Nebuchadrezzar as king over the afflicted land. When he had been ruling nine years we find him in revolt against Babylon. The reasons for this foolish policy are quite evident. The date of his rebellion coincides with the accession of Apries. Tyre and Sidon, Moab and Ammon had also sent their emissaries to the Judean king, and when the weighty influence of Apries also fell into the scales the vacillating Zedekiah was no longer able to withstand, and he half-heartedly joined the rest in casting off the sovereignty of Babylon.

Necho’s interest in maritime progress is further. evidenced by his famous exploring expedition. He dispatched a crew of Phenician mariners with instructions to sail around Africa, or as Herodotus calls it, Libya. As the Egyptians had from the earliest time supposed their land to be sur- rounded by sea, the Oceanos of the Greeks, with which the Nile had connection in the south, the feat of the Phcenicians, which they actually accomplished in three years, excited no surprise. . Psamtik II, who followed his father Necho about 593 B. C., either regarded Egypt’s prospects in Asia as hopeless or continued the compact of his father with Babylon. Un- able to accomplish anything in the North, he turned his attention southward and attempted the recovery of Nubia, lost to Egypt since the foundation of the Ethiopian king- dom. He invaded lower Nubia, and an advanced body of his troops pushed up almost to the second cataract, where they left a record of their visit at Abu Simbel, in a Greek inscription on one of the colossi of Ramses II, before his great temple there.

How many were involved in this revolt under Apries it is impossible to establish, but they were sufficiently numerous to render the king very appre- hensive, and the record of the event distinctly states that ‘‘his majesty feared.’’ As the deserters approached the first cataract Nesuhor, the governor of Assuan, an astute official, succeeded in dissuading them from their purpose and delivering them to the king who then punished them.’ Another misunderstanding with the native warrior-class did not end so happily. The new Greek settlement at Cyrene was growing into a flourishing state and encroaching upon the Libyans who lay between Cyrene and Egypt. Apries deemed it wise to check the development of the Greek colony and sent to the aid of the Libyans a body of Egyptian troops naturally not including among them any of his Greek mer- cenaries. Despising their adversaries, the Egyptians ad- vanced in careless confidence, but were totally defeated and almost annihilated by the Cyrenian Greeks. Smarting un- der their discomfiture they were so filled with resentment toward Apries that they concluded he had dispatched them against Cyrene with the purpose of ridding himself of them.

Being a person of unusual shrewd- ness and insight, his selection at this time might equally well have been the salvation or the ruin of Apries. So skilfully did Amasis manipulate the situation that the dis- affected soldiery soon proclaimed him king, and a messenger of Apries, sent to recall the traitor, was dismissed with in- sult and contumely.

The events for- merly following similar revolts from Assyrian authority were now reénacted under the Babylonians; the allies were unable to act quickly in concert. Indeed Apries made it 1m- possible that they should do so by attacking Tyre and Sidon. He dispatched an expedition to attempt the conquest of the north by sea, perhaps hoping to meet Nebuchadrezzar on the Euphrates as his grandfather Necho had done. He fought a victorious naval engagement with the Tyrians and Cyprians and landed enough troops to take Sidon, where- upon the other Pheenician cities yielded.* It is possible iTV, 988 A-988 J. 2TI Kings 24: 15. 3 Dicdorus, I, 68.

But it was never pushed far enough to accomplish anything inland; and Nebuchadrezzar wisely fixed his base of operations well northward, at Ribleh on the Orontes, where he was able to contemplate the Egyptian operations without concern. His enemies were exhausting themselves against each other, and had Apries advanced inland Nebu- chadrezzar could have quickly confronted him with a force from Ribleh. It is perhaps during this brief supremacy of the Pharaoh in Phenicia that we should place the frag- mentary Kgyptian monuments, pieces of stone statues, altars and bits of imscribed stone from the Saite age, found by Renan at Arvad, Tyre and Sidon.’ Now also the Pharaoh apparently controlled for a time a domain in Lebanon.’ When in the spring of 586 B. C. the troops of Apries at last appeared in the south to threaten the Babylonian besiegers of Jerusalem, they brought the beleagured city a brief mo- ment’s respite only; for the Egyptian forces again showed themselves unable to cope with the armies of Asia.

Seeing one of their colleagues so unjustly punished, many of Apries’ nobles and adherents forsook him and espoused the cause of Amasis. Herodotus narrates that a battle now ensued in which the Greek mer- cenaries of Apries, heavily outnumbered by the native troops of Amasis, were beaten and Apries taken prisoner. It is possible that he is here confusing the situation with the later battle which, as we know from a contemporary docu- ment, occurred between the forces of the two rivals. How- ever this may be, Amasis, while treating Apries with kind- ness and not yet dethroning him, laid a vigourous hand upon the sceptre. A coregency ensued in which Apries doubtless played but a feeble part; and a monument or two shewing the two rulers together has survived. Alongside the car- touche, which he now assumed, Amasis continued to bear the old titles belonging to his former less exalted offices. In the third year of the coregency, however, a struggle between the two regents arose. Apries, as Herodotus knew, gained the adherence of the Greeks, and with an army of these mercenaries, supported by a fleet, advanced upon Sais from the North. Amasis quickly collected his forces and at- tacked, putting Apries and his army to flight and scattering them far and wide. As they continued for some months te LIV, 999 f. 590 A HISTORY OF EGYPT rove the North, infesting the roads, and of course living by plunder, Amasis dispatched a force against them. It would seem that Apries had meantime been a fugitive. In any case, he was slain during this pursuit, while taking his ease on one of the surviving vessels of his fleet. Amasis gave him hon- ourable burial, befitting a king, among his ancestors in Sais, and established for him mortuary offerings endowed with a liberal revenue.! It might have been supposed that Amasis, who owed his crown to an ebullition of national feeling, as opposed to the partiality shown the Greeks, would now have evinced his appreciation of this indebtedness in a marked reaction against foreign influence; but for this he was too sagacious a statesman.

But the character and poli- cies of Amasis clearly disclose the fact that the old Egyp- tian world, whose career we have been following, has already eeased to be. Its vitality, which flickered again into a flame, in the art of the Saitic age, is now quenched forever. The THE FINAL STRUGGLES: BABYLON AND PERSIA 596 Saitic state is but an artificial structure, skilfully built up and sustained by sagacious rulers, but that national career, the characteristics of which were determined by the initiative and vital force of the nation itself had long ago ended. The fall of Egypt and the close of her characteristic history, were already an irrevocable fact long before the relentless Cam- byses knocked at the doors of Pelusium. The Saitic state was a creation of rulers who looked into the future, who belonged to it, and had little or no connection with the past. They were as essentially non-Egyptian as the Ptolemies who followed the Persians. The Persian conquest in 525 B. C., which deprived Psamtik ITI, the son of Amasis of his throne and kingdom, was but a change of rulers, a purely external fact. And if a feeble burst of national feeling enabled this or that Egyptian to thrust off the Persian yoke for a brief period, the movement may be likened to the convulsive con- tractions which sometimes lend momentary motion to limbs from which conscious life has long departed. With the fall of Psamtik III, Egypt belonged to a new world, toward the development of which she had contributed much, but in which she could no longer play an active part. Her great work was done, and unable, like Nineveh and Babylon, to disappear from the scene, she lived on her artificial life for a time under the Persians and the Ptolemies, ever sinking, till she became merely the granary of Rome, to be visited as a land of ancient marvels by wealthy Greeks and Romans, who have left their names scratched here and there upon her hoary monuments, just as the modern tourists, admiring the same marvels, still continue to do.

In any case, he did not achieve the conquest of the country; and Jeremiah’ and Ezekiel,?, who were awaiting with feverish longing the complete overthrow of the hated Pharaoh’s kingdom, must have been sorely disap- pointed that the catastrophe which they had confidently pre- dicted to their countrymen failed to occur. As a result of the campaign, however, Amasis was obliged to renounce any ambitions which he may have cherished for the conquest of Syria-Palestine. His strong navy, nevertheless, enabled him completely to subdue Cyprus, which he organized as an Egyptian dependency, paying tribute to him. His naval strength, which now became formidable, was the foundation of the sea-power, which, under the Ptolemies, made Egypt the dominant state on the Mediterranean. Meanwhile Nebuchadrezzar had died (562 B. C.), and the disappearance of his powerful personality distinctly dimin- ished the prestige of the Babylonian Empire. As internal dissensions arose, the alliance with the Medes was no longer possible, and when finally Cyrus of Anshan, a Persian, suc- ceeded in supplanting the Median dynasty by the overthrow of the Median king, Astyages (550 B. C.), the position of Babylon was critical in the extreme. The extraordinary career of Cyrus was now a spectacle upon which all eyes in the west were fastened with wonder and alarm. Amasis was fully alive to the new danger which threatened his king- dom in common with all the other powers of the West. He therefore in 547 B. C. made common cause with them, form- ing a league with Croesus of Lydia, and the Spartans in the west; and in the east with Nabuna’id of Babylon. Before the allies could move together, Croesus was defeated and dethroned (546-5 B. C.); and the overflowing energies of the new conqueror and his people, fresh and unspent for centuries among their native hills, were then directed upon Babylon, which fell in 539 B. C.

{"context": "In short, they were a nation the like of which we’ve never seen before or again. Gods, pharaohs, pyramids, mummification, agriculture and more helped define the Ancient Egyptians as one of human history’s most fascinating civilisations. 13 Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt The invasions of Egypt led to new cultural aspects being embedded into society, such as the use of horses and chariots Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt The Old Kingdom A time of rebirth, the Old Kingdom saw the introduction of the irst pharaoh, dynasty and pyramid to the world this time. The Old Kingdom began in about 2686 BCE, with the formation of the Third Egyptian Dynasty. The term ‘Old Kingdom’ was introduced by 18th-century historians and is used broadly to signify the first of three peaks of Egyptian civilisation. Often referred to as the ‘Age of the Pyramids’, the Old Kingdom saw Egypt nurture every aspect that would make it great. From the Third Dynasty and its first pharaoh, Djoser, to the apparent last king of the Sixth, Netjerkare Siptah, the nation was transformed into a cultural and military powerhouse. The pyramids are a symbol of this era, and the template for these monumental icons began in the reign of Djoser. His vizier and closest adviser, Imhotep (who would be deified in generations to come as a demigod and god of healing) was the architect behind the Pyramid of Djoser, and his designs were a significant leap in engineering in Ancient Egypt. Prior to Djoser, kings were buried in rectangular, flat-roofed tombs called mastabas, but the Third Dynasty’s founder desired immortality in death by means of a tomb worthy of a divine ruler. Imhotep’s revolutionary design, stacking squared versions of mastabas on top of P rior to the Old Kingdom, in an era known as the Predynastic, Prehistoric or Protodynastic Period, Egypt was going through something of a transformation. The nation was divided into colonies, each with their own lords and rulers. The north and south of the country were also distinct in both practices and culture, with Hierakonpolis the capital of the south and Bes the capital of the north. Excavations over the last century have radically changed the way we view Egypt prior to the Old", "question": "By whom and in which century was the term 'Old Kingdom' introduced?", "answer": "The term 'Old Kingdom' was introduced by 18th-century historians."}

From a region of Western Asia known as Canaan, they took advantage of civil unrest among the Egyptian states and conquered Lower Egypt. The 15th Dynasty saw the introduction of chariots and composite bows, as well as new advances in pottery and agriculture. Agriculture was a cornerstone of Ancient Egypt Hieroglyphics continued to be used up until the fourth century CE Written in hieratic script, the Edwin Smith Papyrus is a medical text 11 O Belief in one god The son of Amenhotep III, Akhenaten shocked the Egyptian world by discarding the old religious doctrines and focusing on one god, Amen. 1349 BCE 30 BCE 1300 BCE 1100 BCE 900 BCE 700 BCE 500 BCE 300 BCE The Amarna Revolution 1370 BCE Setting aside foreign invasions and occupations, some of the biggest upheavals endured by Ancient Egyptians came from within and systematically altered the very fabric of society. The Amarna Revolution, which saw the pharaoh King Amenhotep IV outlaw the polytheistic practices that influenced everything from art to religion in favour of worshipping a single god, was one such upheaval. When Amenhotep IV inherited the throne from his father, he took the name Akhenaten, moved the country’s capital to present- day Tel el Amarna and began defacing temples across the land. Such a central focus on domestic changes caused a great deal of territory in Asia to be lost. Battle of Actium 31 BCE When Roman general-turned- politician Marc Antony married queen Cleopatra VII, it seemed the two nations would finally be united. However, following the assassination of Julius Caesar, Rome was in turmoil.

{"context": "Khufu, the second pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty, was the man to create a monument so grand it would eventually be named one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World: the Great Pyramid of Giza. Built over a two-decade period, the 146.5-metre-high structure was a feat of engineering that put even Imhotep’s Step Pyramid in Sakkara to shame. Giza would become the site of many more pyramids and temples, known as the Giza Necropolis. The Giza 15 Pyramid became the pinnacle of pyramid design in Egypt and it would remain the tallest man-made structure for a staggering 3,800 years. It served as a testament to the power of the pharaohs and the enduring potency of the many Egyptian gods. The Fifth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt (2498 BCE – 2345 BCE) saw an evolution of theological practices across the nation, with certain cults growing in prominence (gods rose and fell in popularity, and usually those favoured by a particular dynasty or geographically important location survived obscurity). The Cult of Ra (god of the noon sun) and the Cult of Osiris (god of the afterlife) rose significantly in popularity during this period of time. The Egyptian economy was also booming, with the influx of goods like ebony, gold, myrrh and frankincense growing all the time. The Egyptians pushed their trading boundaries even further with agreements with Lebanon and modern-day Somalia. In short, it was a time of enterprise without the fear of invasion or war. This economic strength bled into the Sixth Dynasty (2345 BCE – 2181 BCE), as did the growing popularity of the inscription of spells and incantations inside burial chambers and tombs. Known commonly as the Pyramid Texts, these inscriptions would form the basis of the Book of the Dead. Ancient Egypt’s ﬁrst pharaoh Who was the man who unified two distinctly different halves of the same realm and set the stage for the Old Kingdom period? The Old Kingdom was the first true age of prosperity and progress for Egypt, but it would have been nothing without the two dynasties that came before it and the man who founded the pharaonic line to begin with. That man was Narmer and, much like many of the leaders and radicals who changed history in the post-neolithic world, he is a man steeped in myth, legend and mystery. Nevertheless, his actions and decisions at the beginning of the First Dynasty set the precedent for the 29 others that would follow. Narmer ruled sometime during the 31st century", "question": "What ancient Egyptian texts, which formed the basis of the Book of the Dead, became popular during the Sixth Dynasty?", "answer": "The Pyramid Texts, inscriptions of spells and incantations, formed the basis of the Book of the Dead and grew in popularity during the Sixth Dynasty."}
{"context": "Nevertheless, his actions and decisions at the beginning of the First Dynasty set the precedent for the 29 others that would follow. Narmer ruled sometime during the 31st century BCE and became the first man to unite the states of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt. Of course, for an event that happened so far back in prehistory, most of the information we have comes from references found in tombs and the conclusions drawn by Egyptologists and historians, but there are some intriguing details we can take from them. Seal impressions found in tombs at Abydos linked to the pharaohs Qa’a and Den (both of whom ruled, to the best of our knowledge, after Narmer during the First Dynasty) cite a list of ancient kings that name Narmer as the first. There have even been stone vessels (elaborate vases) found in the Step Pyramid tomb of Djoser that pay tribute to Narmer, perhaps expressing an intended connection with the founder and his way of life. Some historians argue that a ruler by the name of Menes was in fact the founder of founders, while others theorise Narmer and Menes were one and the same. There’s even an argument that Narmer is a pseudonym for the mysterious monarch King Scorpion, but currently no evidence exists to corroborate this claim The Great Sphinx of Giza is believed to have been built in the time of Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Khafra Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt The Old Kingdom boasted a strong centralised administration from the capital of Memphis 16 Book of Ancient Egypt effort was continued by his son and successor Mentuhotep III.

The Turin Papyrus (otherwise known as the Turin King List) is one such document; it describes the period following Mentuhotep III’s death as “seven kingless years”.

Even after unification, the nomarchs – 20 of whom were based in Lower Egypt and 22 in Upper Egypt – remained. However, they existed more as regional officials who would report directly to the royal court. As the country entered the First Intermediate Period, these nomes began to assume autonomy once again.

However, in mere moments Ptolemy’s advisors realised their mistake, for the Roman general was completely and utterly appalled. He wept loudly and openly before leading his forces to the royal palace in Alexandria. As he observed the local resentment and civil war threatening to break the land in two he made a decision; he needed the wealth that Alexandrian taxes would give him, and the only way of increasing taxes was to establish stability in the city. The sibling rivalry had to end. He summoned Cleopatra and Ptolemy to appear before him. This was easy for Ptolemy who swiftly journeyed to Alexandria, but Cleopatra would have to use all her cunning just to make it into the city alive. With the harbour blocked by her brother’s ships, she slipped away from her troops and travelled in a small boat along the coast in the dead of night. Her journey had been completely and utterly unfitting for a pharaoh of Egypt, a Ptolemy queen; but victory demanded sacrifice and she was confident the streets and waters she was being smuggled down would soon be hers again. It had been a challenge to make it into the palace district, but the real night’s work was about to begin – she was about to go face to face with arguably the most powerful man in the known world. Her brother would bend over backwards, slay Caesar’s enemies and kiss his feet for his support, but he was quick to panic, eager to please and terrified of angering Rome. Her brother was a fool.

Displaying the brutal and uncompromising ferocity that ran through his entire family, he had his daughter summarily executed. He then proceeded to reclaim the throne, from which he ruled until his death in 51 BCE. The crown and all the debts he had amassed became the property of his oldest surviving daughter, Cleopatra. The 18-year-old was not – as some expected – a naïve, wide- eyed child torn from her books to rule a kingdom on the brink of war. She had served as consort to her father for the final few years of his reign and all her education since birth had been designed to mould her into a capable queen. Queen, that was; not king, not pharaoh. Cleopatra was cursed by the requirement of all Egyptian queens to serve alongside a dominant male co-ruler and so found herself burdened with the task of being a subordinate co-regent to her ten- year-old brother, Ptolemy XIII. Faced with a regency council full of ambitious men who ruled in her brother’s stead and led by her own ruthless, impatient and intelligent nature, Cleopatra pushed her brother-husband into the background and established herself as sole monarch of the country. This was dangerous; the Alexandrian courtiers swarmed over the young, impressionable king, filling his head with whispers of sole rule and the dangers of his older sister.

When his conquest of Asia resumed in 331 BCE, Alexander and Darius met again at Gaugamela, arguably the Macedonian king’s most famous victory. The ancient historians numbered the Persian troops at one million strong – a ridiculous figure, though few modern historians would deny that they greatly outnumbered the Greeks who totalled around 47,000 men.

It is fitting that this sole recorded dream-memory should reference the epic poet, for Alexander strived to embody the Homeric ideal above all. Like Hector or Achilles, he would stand astride history as one of its most celebrated warriors, his deeds in life still echoing down to modern times. According to one of Alexander’s greatest modern biographers, Robin Lane Fox, the Macedonian king feasted upon the words of Homer, “not as a distant reader but more in the spirit of a marcher baron living out the ballads which mirrored his home world.” The seed of that home world was Macedonia, a kingdom lying to the north of Greece. In 356 BCE its king, Philip II, and his queen, Olympias, welcomed the birth of Alexander, who grew up a strong and able-bodied young man. At the age of 16 he acted as regent while his father waged war against the Persians. Two years later he won his laurels commanding the left wing of Philip’s army at the battle of Chaeronea, which brought Athens under the Macedonian yoke. In 336 BCE, Philip was murdered. His son inherited the throne and his father’s Persian campaign. Upon his accession, a confederacy of enemies menaced the young king on all sides, though he quickly crushed the irksome Illyrians and razed rebellious Thebes to the ground. In 334 BCE he crossed the Hellespont into Asia Minor and in Cilica earned one of a number of key victories over the Persians. More victories followed, before he then besieged Tyre and Gaza. The conclusion to the siege of Gaza saw its male population slaughtered and the women and children sold into slavery, as was the custom of the time.

Ramesses’ destination was Kadesh, a heavily fortified Syrian city in the Orontes River valley. Kadesh was an important centre of trade and commerce and the de facto capital of the Amurru kingdom, a highly coveted piece of land sandwiched on the border between the Egyptian and Hittite empires. As a boy, Ramesses had ridden alongside his father Seti I, when the elder Egyptian king finally wrested Kadesh from the Hittites after more than half a century of abortive attempts. But as soon as Seti returned victorious to Egypt, the scheming rulers of Kadesh re-pledged their allegiance to the Hittites. Ramesses had returned to Syria to salvage two tarnished reputations: his father’s and that of his empire. Ramesses and his army had been marching for a month. They departed from the pharaoh’s royal residence along the eastern edge of the lush Nile Delta in April, cutting across the Sinai peninsula, following the curve of the Mediterranean coastline up through Canaan, past the strategic highland outpost of Meggido, into the fertile valleys of Lebanon and finally arriving in the forests outside Kadesh. The pharaoh’s scouts fanned out to assess the enemy’s preparations for battle. The locals painted a deceptively favourable picture. The Hittite king Muwatalli was so afraid of the great Ramesses and his legendary charioteers that the Hittite army was biding its time a hundred miles away.

During the first ten years of his father Seti I’s reign as pharaoh, a teenage Ramesses sired ten sons and at least as many daughters. Over the course of his long lifetime, Ramesses had six to eight principal wives, dozens of lesser wives and untold numbers of concubines. He is believed to have fathered an estimated 80 sons and 60 daughters, an impressive and somewhat excessive number, even by pharaoh standards. Ramesses had good reason for spreading his seed. Although he was born into a common family, Ramesses was intent on reinstating a pure dynastic bloodline. He gave his male heirs high-ranking administrative posts and trained each of his first 12 sons as possible successors, but none of them managed to outlive Ramesses. The thirteenth son, Merenptah, assumed the throne around 1214 BCE, but despite Ramesses’ best efforts, the Ramessid Dynasty withered away in only 150 years.

To understand the impressive scope of Ramesses’ architectural vision, we only have to look to the royal city that bore his name, Per-Ramesses, or Piramesse. Located 120 kilometres (75 miles) from modern-day Cairo, Piramesse began as a humble summer palace built by Ramesses’ father Seti I near the family’s ancestral home on the eastern edge of the Nile Delta. Over the course of 18 years of construction and expansion, Piramesse became the third-largest religious centre of Egypt — next to Memphis and Thebes — and the political capital of the entire empire. Very little of Piramesse’s grandeur remains today, but first-hand accounts describe a city of incomparable beauty and wealth. The Royal Quarter sat on a hill overlooking the Nile.

If you believe the Poem of Pentaur, which adorns the walls of temples at Luxor, Karnak, Abu Simbel and more, then King Muwatalli was so cowed by Ramesses’ superhuman strength that he immediately petitioned for surrender. But is that really how the Battle of Kadesh went down? Do historians believe the account of the Poem of Pentaur, that a single man defeated an entire Hittite army? Hardly. Ramesses the Great, most Egyptologists now believe, deserves his title not for his heroics on the battlefield or his potency as a patriarch – he allegedly fathered well over 100 children – but for his flair for propaganda. Ramesses was, quite literally, the greatest image-maker of antiquity. Those visiting the ruins of the great Egyptian temples today are sure to find themselves in awe of a seated stone statue of Ramesses II guarding the gate, or a series of identical Ramesses sculptures supporting interior pillars. “ The heavy chariots ploughed through the Egyptian ranks, littering the hillside with corpses” To everyday citizens staring up at his colossal and unblemished image, they would have no choice but to believe the statue’s unspoken message: here stands your king, your ruler, your god.

Standing six-feet tall with a square jutting jaw, thick lips and a long sharp nose, Ramesses II rode his golden chariot ahead of an army of 20,000 archers, charioteers and sandalled infantrymen. Only five years into his reign as pharaoh, he had already established himself as a fierce warrior and strategic military commander, the rightful blood heir to the newly established 19th Dynasty and a true spiritual son of the goddess Isis herself. Ramesses’ soldiers would have seen their commander-in-chief as the rest of Egypt did: as a god in the flesh possessed of legendary strength and bravery, incapable of error and on a divine mission to re-establish Egypt as the dominant superpower of the Middle East.

Ramesses likely chose the city’s location for its proximity to the fortress at Sile, the traditional gateway to the eastern provinces of Palestine, Syria and the Asiatic empires beyond. Foreign diplomats, traders and migrant labourers arrived at the newly built capital in droves. In addition to the traditional Egyptian temples built to Seth and Amun, there were foreign cults dedicated to Ba’al, Anat and the Syrian goddess Astarte, whom the pharaoh adopted as the patron deity of his chariot horses. Piramesse may have been the ‘Ramses’ of the Old Testament, where Hebrew slaves were put to work on the pharaoh’s great storehouses. Whether Ramesses himself was indeed the wicked pharaoh of The Ten Commandments fame is another matter. Importantly, the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt were more than mere figureheads: they served multiple roles as religious leaders, military generals and political rulers. The pharaoh’s ultimate responsibility was to lead the empire toward ma’at, the ideal state of cosmic harmony, justice, order and peace. The Egyptians were skilled astronomers and charted the orderly and predictable movements of celestial bodies, each connected with a god or goddess. The goal of individual human beings and Egyptian society as a whole was to reflect the divine harmony of the heavens on Earth.

The site originally held a modest summer palace constructed by Ramesses’ father, Seti I, but the great pharaoh gave it the supersize treatment, adding more than 10km2 (4mi2) of mansions, social halls, military barracks and an enormous, opulently tiled throne room, which was fittingly dedicated to the great pharaoh, Ramesses himself.

Nefertiti: Behind the beauty 52 Book of Ancient Egypt 53 Nefertiti: Behind the beauty “Nefertiti was virtually wiped from Egypt’s historical records” Along with Cleopatra, Nefertiti has reached iconic status as a ‘Queen’ of Ancient Egypt. Nefertiti and her pharaoh husband Akhenaten became embroiled in a religious revolution in which they only worshipped Aten, bringing upheaval to the realm. It’s thought that Nefertiti ruled as Neferneferuaten after Akhenaten’s death, but no one knows for sure. c. 1370-1330 BCE NEFERTITI Brief Bio The ruins of Amarna as seen today, surrounded by inhospitable cliffs But in the fifth year of Amenhotep’s reign, something extraordinary happened. The pharaoh changed his name to Akhenaten, plundered and closed down the temples and threw the priests out of office. After thousands of years of polytheism, he and Nefertiti declared that there was now only one true god: Aten, the sun-disc. And the only way to reach this god was through the pharaoh himself. Akhenaten then led a mass exodus from the ancient capital of Thebes and set about building a new city in the middle of the desert, which he called ‘Amarna’. This was to be the new centre of the Ancient Egyptian empire. The city was surrounded on three sides by inhospitable cliffs – a natural defence against enemies of the crown. The young pharaoh knew that his actions had not been popular, and the rumblings of unrest could be felt across the kingdom. With this religious revolution also came a cultural one.

But what is perhaps most extraordinary about the art of Amarna is the way Queen Nefertiti was portrayed. Reliefs and statues show Nefertiti chariot-racing, smiting enemies and even leading worship – roles that before had always been reserved for the pharaoh. During the first five years of their reign, she appeared in reliefs almost twice as often as her husband, and is often shown as being of equal size to him, suggesting that Nefertiti was far more powerful than the wives of the pharaohs before her. However, it wasn’t long before this period of rich culture and peace came to an abrupt end. Akhenaten had exhausted nearly all of his resources in building his new city and the nation was on the brink of bankruptcy.

What we do know is that her face was one of timeless beauty – her name means ‘the beautiful one has come’ – and she would have been a desirable match for the young Egyptian prince, then known as Amenhotep. The pair were married in their mid-teens, had their first child shortly after, and ascended the throne around 1351 BCE. What is known of their early reign is sketchy, but archaeologists have deduced that throughout the 18th Dynasty, a cult of the god Amun had grown incredibly powerful, so much so that by the time Amenhotep was crowned, the cult’s priests were almost as powerful as the pharaoh himself. O n 6 December 1912, an Egyptian workman digging along the banks of the River Nile unearthed one of the most precious treasures in the history of Egyptology. The man was one of many working on the excavation of an ancient sculptor’s workshop, a dig overseen by German archaeologist Ludwig Borchardt. As he felt the knowing jolt of his pick against hard stone, he brushed away the earth to reveal the distinctive colours of ancient paintwork, and immediately called for his superior.

Digging deeper, they revealed a pair of full, red lips; a dramatic, sloping nose; almond eyes; and dark, arching eyebrows. Finally, they uncovered a huge cylindrical crown, one that had only been seen before in the few existing depictions of one Ancient Egyptian: Queen Nefertiti.

{"context": "The government of Ancient Egypt was a theocracy with the pharaoh as absolute monarch. But that doesn’t mean that Ramesses personally oversaw each and every aspect of Egyptian civil life. His chief political officers were two viziers, one each for Upper and Lower Egypt. Serving as chief justices of the Egyptian courts, viziers conducted the tasks of collecting taxes, managing the grain reserves, settling territorial disputes and keeping careful records of rainfall and the Nile’s water levels. Treasurers managed the finances of ‘church’ and state, as well as running the stone quarries that built national shrines. If an average Egyptian had a grievance, he would take it up with the local governors in charge of each of Egypt’s 42 nomes – or states. Governors reported to the viziers, who met daily with the pharaoh for counsel. During his long life, Ramesses renovated or constructed more temples than any pharaoh in all 30 Ancient Egyptian dynasties. He also placed his figure prominently inside each and every one of them, often on equal footing with the gods. At first, this appears to be an unparalleled act of hubris. But seen through the lens of the Egyptian religious mind, this spiritual self-promotion starts to make sense. If the highest goal of Egyptian civilisation is to achieve ma’at or divine harmony, then you need a supreme leader whose very will is in absolute harmony with the gods. Through his numerous construction projects, Ramesses proved his devotion to the gods while also nurturing his own thriving cult of personality. Ramesses built some truly refined and subtle temples, especially his small addition to his father Seti I’s monumental temple complex at Abydos. But refined and subtle was not in his nature. For starters, he liked to do things quickly. In traditional temple construction, all decorative motifs on the outside of a temple were hewn using incised relief, in which images and hieroglyphs are carved into the stone to accentuate the contrast of sun and shadow. In the darkened interiors of temples, however, artists used the more time-consuming bas-relief method, in which drawings and symbols are raised relative to the background. In the interest of time, Ramesses ordered all of his temples to be etched in incise relief inside and out. That’s one reason why Ramesses built more temples than any king before or since.", "question": "What artistic method did Ramesses II order to be used for all of his temple carvings, and why?", "answer": "Ramesses II ordered all of his temples to be etched using the incised relief method, both inside and out, to speed up construction."}

However, it wasn’t uncommon for one god or goddess to rise in prominence if favoured by a particular monarch – the Thebans of the 11th Dynasty had chosen Amun, and his prominence had risen even higher following the expulsion of the Hyksos. The church had grown with him and now controlled as much land and wealth as the king, often attempting to influence politics within Amenhotep III’s court.

Specifically, how were the massive two-ton blocks placed 480 feet above the desert floor? A French architect named Jean-Pierre Houdin has posits a theory to explain the mystery. Houdin has devoted his time to studying the Great Pyramid and creating graphical models using 3D software. He proposes that an external ramp was built to haul the rocks – pulled by means of ropes – for the first 60 metres or so of the pyramid. Then an internal ramp was built to continue hauling rocks up. It is a mile- long, narrow structure spiralling inside the pyramid, much like the ramps in a parking garage. To allow for men to haul the stones, the ramp is at a seven per cent slope. Somehow it has remained hidden inside the pyramid since its completion 4,500 years ago. But how would men hauling the blocks up the ramp make the turn at each corner of the ramp? They would need a place to stand in front of the blocks. Houdin believes that each corner was temporarily left open, with a notch of about three square metres. Wooden cranes were stationed in each open space to lift the blocks onto the next level of the ramp. Later the notches were filled in. There is some evidence that an internal ramp exists at the Great Pyramid. In 1986, a team of French scientists used microgravimetrics to survey the pyramid. They were looking for hidden chambers by checking for areas of low density, which would indicate open spaces. The team did find one new chamber that was filled with sand.

Imhotep’s long- standing association with King Djoser led to his name being inscribed on one of Djoser’s statues, but his presence was far more palpable than a simple footnote in the history of a king. Around a century after his death, Imhotep’s reputation as an impeccable physician, sage and healer saw him reborn as a demigod of medicine. Two thousand years later, ideas of his saintly prominence gained momentum and he was fully deified. He was worshipped by various cults of Imhotep during the 26th and 27th Dynasties and followers would pay tribute at a temple that was built in his honour just outside Memphis.

Then, when the Greeks conquered Egypt in 332 BCE, Imhotep’s symbolism in healing and medicine became intertwined with the Greek equivalent, Asclepius. This increased his fame and following in the wake of the Ptolemaic era. Imhotep’s cult reached its zenith in Greco-Roman times, during which his temples in Philae, Memphis and along the Nile were often packed with those seeking healing at the hands of the god-physician.

Records surrounding Imhotep’s earliest years are patchy, but estimates place his date of birth in the vicinity of 2650 BCE. His father is said to have been a man named Kanofer, who was a celebrated architect; his mother is said to have a woman called Khreduonkh from the province of Mendes. The particulars of his childhood and his ascent into young manhood remain shrouded in even deeper layers of mystery, but it’s clear that, at some point in the early years of King Djoser’s reign, the young man was rising in prominence. A veritable polymath, Imhotep became famed for his intellect. He worked as a scribe and learned his trade as an engineer, two careers that would do him well in the court of the pharaoh. He also turned his attention to medicine, and it was in this field that Imhotep forged just one of his many legacies. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, so named after the dealer who purchased it in 1862, is purported to be based on the works and cases of Imhotep himself and describes in incredible detail the types of procedures performed on patients in the age of the Old Kingdom. The document itself, a rarity considering it depicts applicable medicine rather than arcane treatments also attributed to the era, was written around 1700 BCE, but is likely based on medical practices performed a thousand years previous. It describes around 48 procedures, ranging from the treatment of head traumas to tumours and spinal issues. Whether this document was truly based on Imhotep’s own work or simply inspired by his legend isn’t clear, but his medical genius was undisputed and would drive his later deification. However, it should be said that Imhotep was not a man of pure science in a world that clung to magic and superstition. To the Ancient Egyptians, magic and science were one, and Imhotep is as likely to have studied and conducted practices as a sage as he would have as a physician.

In order to hold the structure in place, Imhotep used fine limestone (an expensive commodity at the time) with packing in between. He incorporated the basic design of the traditional flat-roofed mastaba, but instead made each section a square rather than a rectangle. Each ‘step’ was constructed by building in accretion layers that leant inwards towards the core of the structure (rather than the flat, horizontal building technique used on mastabas) – this design choice was crucial, since the structure needed to be strong enough to hold itself in place without imploding. Imhotep added a passageway within the structure that led directly to the sarcophagus chamber, as well as a complicated network of tunnels and chambers. The pyramid itself was created as a means of holding and protecting the king’s remains and treasures, but it also formed a vital part of a larger complex. A number of buildings, statues and pillars were constructed on site, all of which were surrounded by a stone wall that reached 10.7 metres (35 feet) high and was encased in limestone. The treasures of the king – 36,000 vessels filled with precious metals – were lowered from above into chambers beneath the surface. The chamber only had one opening, which was closed off with a 3.5 ton block. Pyramids of a polymath the king finally had a worthy tomb.

An ordinary working Egyptian man, such as a farmer, would have had no slaves at the home to help him prepare for the day ahead. His wife would have been responsible for preparing the children for the day. A bench would suffice as a place to eat at and the family would sit on reed mats. When the farmer went out to work on his land, his wife would typically remain at home and tend to domestic work, such as preparing food. A farmer would have been required to take some of his harvest to the temple as payment for using the temple land. Evening meals for the family were modest.

{"context": "At the very highest rung of the social ladder, the pharaoh was regarded as a living god, in particular a manifestation of the earthly embodiment of Horus, the god of order, who was the son of the goddess Isis. The pharaoh was responsible for maintaining order and ensuring that the gods were kept happy with human endeavour. It’s also unsurprising that the pharaoh’s interests and responsibilities included military campaigns. The women at the centre of the king’s life were also accorded great status. One of the most famous royal marriages was that of Akhenaten and Nefertiti. In cartouches dated to the Second Intermediate Period, the name of a king’s wife would be represented. Indeed, a number of Old and Middle Kingdom wives of kings were buried in a pyramid. Below the king on the social pyramid was the ruling elite, comprised of nobles and priests. There Ancient Egypt evolved a strikingly formalised class structure, which was the foundation of social order. A rigid social hierarchy typically denied what we would now call upward social mobility, which was not a common experience. History records that individuals in society could be defined by seven classes. At the top of the pyramid was the pharaoh, who was considered divine, and below him were the further seven levels of society: the priests and officials, and then below them the warrior class. Below the warriors were scribes, and below them merchants then craftsmen. Below craftsmen were farmers and the boatmen that traversed the River Nile and its tributaries. Critically, we must recognise that the culture also comprised slaves (typically former prisoners of war), as well as marginalised individuals and groups existing on the fringes of the mainstream.

Entrance hall The first room on entering the house would have been elaborately decorated, with a shrine to honour the god Bes, who was the protector of the family. 95 Life on the banks of the Nile Key to developing a culture’s sense of identity is not just work and big-picture value systems; how the society entertains itself is also important to consider. Board games were hugely popular in Ancient Egypt, notably one game called Senet – an especially well-known and simple game that people played for more than 2,000 years. Senet simply involved throwing sticks down in order to determine how far a player’s game piece would advance along a board. For the pharaohs, hunting was the king’s sport just as it once was in Britain. Then there was the Nile itself, which was the perfect venue for swimming and sailing. As with most, if not all, cultures, music was a key part of the creative expression in the daily life of Egyptian people. The harp and lyre were widely used instruments, and we can imagine how perhaps their love of poetry related well to their musical inclinations. Archaeologists have excavated a collection of such poems in a village named Deir el-Medina.

We bid to shed light on a complex belief system built on mythology and superstition Praying to the gods 102 Book of Ancient Egypt 102 © Alamy The land was divided into two — Upper Egypt to the south, also known as the Nile Valley, and Lower Egypt in the north, known as the Nile Delta (where the river split into seven tributaries before feeding into the Mediterranean). The atmosphere of each was markedly different. The Nile Valley, bordered on each side by desert and mountains, offered an entirely insular and traditional way of life, fully focused on the life-giving river, which, when in flood, fed the fertile Black Land on its banks. Beyond it was the barren Red Land, and popular thought separated the two. One was the land of the living, home to food, flora and fauna; the other the land of the dead, the abode of graveyards, ghosts and the wild animals of the turbulent god Seth. Life in Lower Egypt was different. The air was cooler and more moist. The sea, and land access to Libya, allowed a little more influence from foreign lands. It is said that the people of Egypt always considered these two lands as separate countries, though united under one crown. “This ideal of a balanced tension between two matched, opposing forces was a constantly repeated theme in all of Egypt’s myths,” wrote the scholar Joyce Tyldesley. Tyldesley highlights as opposites Upper and Lower Egypt; the Red Land and the Black; the east and west banks of the Nile; day and night; men and women; and life and death. “In particular, the conflict between chaos (isfet) and order (ma’’at) was fundamental to Egyptian thought,” she writes.

Within these waters floated the spark of the creator, which burst forth as the first light or sound of creation. There are a number of surviving stories recording aspects of this primal moment. In the creation myth of Heliopolis, which tells of the first four generations of deities, the creator is Atum. Born from an egg, he is said to have emerged from the waters onto a mound, bringing light to the world.

Egyptologist Geraldine Pinch has constructed a mythical timeline that lays out the principle events of Egyptian myth in the order that logic decrees (although she readily concedes that the ancients themselves never attempted such synthesis). She divides Egypt’s mythical story into seven stages: chaos, the emergence of the creator, the creation of the world and its inhabitants, the reign of the Sun god, rule by other deities, rule by semi- divine kings (human history), and the return to chaos. Before creation, there was chaos, perceived The Book of the Dead is a 19th-century name for a collection of sources also called The Spells for Going Forth by Day 104 Book of Ancient Egypt as deep, unknowable waters called nun. In the creation myth of Heliopolis, nun contained a floating egg and within this resided the potential for life. In this myth, Atum emerged as the creator, though other creator deities existed elsewhere, including the likes of Ra, Shu, Ptah, Khnum, Isis, Hathor and Neith. Key stages in the creation of the world and its inhabitants, says Pinch, were the establishment of ma’at, the divine order; the division of beings into male and female; and the separation of the earth and the sky. The creation of humanity, she says, does not occupy a central position in Egyptian myth and there are even some creation stories that completely omit humans altogether. When humanity does feature, it sometimes springs from divine tears, such as those shed by the creator upon the return of his children, Shu and Tefnut. Elsewhere, mankind arrives with the tears of Ra, which he cries in sorrow upon his birth and separation from his mother. In stories of Ptah, the god who is closely linked with masons and sculptors, is cited as having crafted people as well as having formed the gods. The next stage in this linear timeline is the period of rule by the Sun god, Ra, who reigned over both humans and gods – both of whom lived on Earth.

In some traditions, Thoth is cited as a son of Ra but without a mother, or even as the offspring of two fathers, Horus and Seth. He mediated in the conflict between these two gods and was widely employed as a mediatory influence in many other tales. “However, even the most mild-mannered of accountants may be capable of violence,” wrote one commentator, who recalls an old tale of Thoth from the Pyramid Texts, in which he appears as an aggressive blade-wielder who is quick to decapitate his enemies. The centre of his cult was at Hermopolis (the Greeks equating him with their winged messenger Hermes), and as a lunar deity he was often depicted crossing the night sky in a boat. Alternative tales cited him as the navigator on Ra’s sky boat.

Isis’s role as the ideal wife and mother emphasised her qualities of loyalty and fertility. “The unselfish love that Isis displays towards Osiris and Horus,” wrote one scholar, “is rare in Egyptian myth.” This selflessness was applauded during the Greco-Roman period, when Plutarch wrote that the all-powerful deity sought to console suffering humans. “This, and her promise to believers of a happy afterlife,” said one modern writer, “made the Isis cult the closest rival to Christianity in the early centuries of the first millennium.” Her myths, however, showed diversity, and one text recorded how she fooled the divine ferryman to trick her enemy, Seth. In another tale she obtained her magical powers via trickery, encouraging a serpent to bite the Sun god Ra. As the god suffered and approached death, Isis agreed to cure him, but only if he ceded some of his power. When Horus is poisoned, she halted the journey of the solar barge until he was cured.

The lengthy river was the lifeblood of Ancient Egypt; it was from its proximity that the earliest pharaohs could sow healthy crops in a Saharan environment, while turning the swampland of the Delta (a series of small rivers and tributaries that poured into the Mediterranean Sea) into one of the most agriculturally lush and fertile stretches of land in the world. And yet it also proved as much a danger to the Egyptians as a life-giving treasure. The Nile was teeming with parasites, so for those who bathed in it or drank from it, the chances of becoming ill were likely considerable. Those who went wading through its cool waters, most notably along the irrigation channels, were in danger of crossing paths with parasites like the Schistosoma worm. This dastardly little blighter would bore its way through your feet or legs and lay eggs in your bloodstream. These worms would hatch and work their way through the body, causing a terrible amount of harm and making the host sick and frail. And for those who dared to drink water from wells that drew on the Nile, they risked the chance of ingesting guinea worms. Female guinea worms would often travel through the body to a suitable nesting site, usually the legs, and force a host into a weak and sickened state.

This association earned him the epithet ‘The Red One’. In mythic tales, he took the form of dangerous animals, like bulls, wild cats and crocodiles, and was linked to the fantastical griffin. His conflict with Osiris is shrouded in mystery, although some thought his murderous assault was prompted by his passion for his brother’s bride, Isis. The Greek historian Plutarch, meanwhile, thought that “the brilliant Seth, who so longed to be king, was forced to stand by while his dull but worthy brother ruled.” After his murderous act, Seth reigned as a usurper, which brought him into conflict with his brother’s posthumous son, Horus.

Despite their distant place in history, Ancient Egyptians were quite advanced in their ability to diagnose a variety of ailments and illnesses (both long-forgotten and familiar). The remedies they used were almost entirely drawn from nature, so many of them have survived to today as modern herbal medicines and alternative treatments. Almost all of our knowledge of these diagnoses come from the incredibly detailed records in the Edwin Smith Papyrus (c. 1600 BCE), the Berlin Medical Papyrus (c. 1250 BCE), the Kahun Papyrus (c. 1900 BCE), the London Medical Papyrus (c. 1250 BCE) and the Ebers Papyrus (c. 1600 BCE) – each of which details the Egyptians’ knowledge of disease, anatomy and healing. These texts express an incredibly precise understanding of human anatomy – the practice of mummification gave those involved a deeply intimate knowledge of the body’s composition and natural balances. And considering that many physicians were also priests, it seems possible surgeons would have cut their teeth in the sanctity of mummification before The papyri unearthed in the last few hundred years have radically changed our understanding of ancient Egyptian medicine. Egyptian doctors recorded countless procedures and diagnoses in detail, creating a unique insight into how a healer in this era identified and treated everything from inflammation to depression. The Ebers Papyrus, purchased by German Egyptologist Georg Ebers in the winter of 1873-1874 in Luxor, is one such document. A 100-page scroll roughly 20 metres long, the papyrus dates back to around 1550 BCE, making it one of the oldest medical papyri ever discovered. Another early medical document, the Brugsch Papyrus (1300-1200 BCE) provides similar information to the Ebers. The Ebers Papyrus covers a wide variety of ailments, illnesses and disorders, as well as over 700 remedies and treatments. It contains incantations and spells to banish disease-causing demons alongside incredibly detailed – and accurate – descriptions of the heart. The Egyptians correctly identified that the heart was at the centre of the body’s blood supply. The papyrus also states that the heart is responsible for pumping four separate fluids around the body – blood, urine, tears and semen – much in the same way medieval doctors believed the body was based on a balance of very similar ‘humours’.

Alongside the removal of cysts and tumours, cases of amputations being performed have been recorded. There was also a good chance of surviving such a gruesome experience; the experience of the Egyptian physician and a vast knowledge of the medicinal properties of the natural resources around them meant that these ancient GPs were capable of treating incredibly severe problems. An amputee, for instance, would have had their wound treated with willow or even cauterised in some cases. That knowledge of natural remedies stretched far beyond surgery and fed into the everyday practices of a local healer. Mint and caraway were used to treat chest pains; mustard seeds, aloe and juniper were used to treat headaches; poppy seeds were used in the treatment of both insomnia and burns; camphor counteracted bouts of vomiting; mustard seeds were used as emetic when needed, while mint was used to stop the effects. As Egypt expanded its borders during the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms, new ingredients and remedies would have become available as traders from Libya, Canaan, Nubia and those from further afield in Asia arrived in Egypt. However, all these records of anatomical knowledge and practical remedies seem to fly in the face of the deeply religious fabric of Ancient Egyptian society. Magic formed as much a part of the Egyptian view of the universe as science, so it’s unsurprising that this broad theological view informed the practice of medicine. The presence of demons or malevolent spirits were sometimes presented or diagnosed as being the cause of a particular ailment.

One of our main sources for insights into Egyptian mining practice is found in the writings of Diodorus Siculus, the Greek historian. The Egyptian terrain was rich in a range of minerals and resources, and gold was one such naturally occurring treasure. As far back as the fourth millennium BCE, the Egyptian people were beginning to access gold via alluvial deposits. Then, as of around 3100 BCE, engineers developed efficient and productive mining operations that were located in the mountain range east of Coptos and also in the south in Nubia. Consistent with so much else in their sense of the immediate and the eternal, the Ancient Egyptians connected the real practicalities of the world with their religious system: they considered gold to be the flesh of Ra, the Sun god. Because Ra was an undying deity, gold too became a talisman of sorts, embodying eternal life.

His mouth was dry, his tongue heavy and with all the effort he could muster he managed three words: “Yes, wonderful things.” From Alexander to Caesar to Hadrian, Egypt and its ancient mysteries has been a source of fascination and intrigue for some of the greatest figures in human history. However, it was Napoleon, following the lead of his heroes, who truly unleashed the era of scientific Egyptology upon the world. When Napoleon set sail to the Orient on 19 May 1789 with his 17,000 troops and machines of war, he also brought over 150 engineers, scientists, scholars, architects, surveyors and cartographers who were eager to map and study the wonders they could unearth.

A thirst for the wonders of Ancient Egypt swept through Napoleon’s army, and even the ambitious young general himself began to catch the fever.

In 1797, Danish archaeologist Georg Zoëga wrote: “If Egypt becomes more accessible, and the numerous ancient monuments that are to be seen there are carefully studied and documented, perhaps future generations will someday read the hieroglyphs and understand what those mysterious monuments mean.” That day was to come much sooner than he ever could have expected.

The Sphinx faces directly east and its stonework features once included a cobra-embellished headdress and a beard. Although neither the Sphinx nor its principal architect were cited within the content of any hieroglyphs from the time, the ‘foreman’ of the project is widely regarded to be Pharaoh Khafre (c. 2558- 2532 BCE), the ruler of the Old Kingdom, which was a period of early Egyptian civilisation that endured for 2,500 years. Incidentally, Khafre’s father – Khufu (c. 2589-2566 BCE) – built the Great Pyramid at Giza approximately 400 metres (1,300 feet) from where the Sphinx statue would later be carved. Regarding the identity of the labour force, an Old Kingdom cemetery containing the tombs of some 600 possible workers and overseers was unearthed in the early Nineties. Following that, in 1999 Egyptian archaeologist Mark Lehner found a settlement dating back to the reign of Khafre, capable of accommodating between 1,600 and 2,000 people – a rather convenient Sphinx construction workforce, perhaps? 4,500 years ago, before bronze and iron were prevalent, the available tools for this colossal undertaking would have included copper implements and stone hammers. Modern reconstructions, using similar stone and ancient-style tools, have estimated that the Sphinx could have been constructed in just three years with 100 people chipping away at a rate of 0.03 cubic metres (one cubic foot) per week. Using the huge excavation of stone quarried away from the Sphinx enclosure (the pit in which the statue sits), the labourers were also able to construct the nearby Sphinx Temple.

While doing so, he supervised a number of excavations at Thebes and was eventually given funding for his own projects. It was also around this time that European exploration and study of Ancient Egypt began. Then came the Renaissance, which sparked a new interest in classical antiquity, Egypt included. Its teachings were considered a source of great knowledge, and the first attempts were made to decipher hieroglyphics. Bizarrely, mummies also began to be mined extensively for the alleged medicinal properties of the ground corpses.

It took two and a half months to complete the mammoth task. It was a nerve-wracking experience for Carter and his team, as they risked the ancient – and very delicate – artefacts crumbling to dust at their touch. Every single chest they uncovered had to undergo a mini excavation of the seemingly random jumble of ancient items that had been hastily stuffed inside.

Initial research into the stone is commenced during that summer. 1801 In 1801, with the British having defeated Napoleon’s army in Egypt, the Rosetta Stone arrives at the British Museum in London, where scholars then continue to study it. The Greek text is readily translated and scholars identify that each section narrates the same information. This is a critical realisation: it means that the scholars understand that they will be able to translate the meaning of the hieroglyphics. The Rosetta Stone records a decree from pharaoh Ptolemy V that dates from 196 BCE. September 1799 The Courrier de l’Egypte publishes the first publicly available news of the discovery of the Rosetta Stone. The article draws together initial research undertaken at the Institute of Egypt. Scholars Jean- Joseph Marcel and Remi Raige determine the cursive Demotic text on the stone, but at this stage cannot decipher it. In August 1800, study on the stone begins at the Institute of Egypt in Cairo. Inevitably, perhaps, arguments quickly begin to develop around ownership of the treasure. by virtue of becoming rare, they took on a special resonance and cultural value as a ‘lost’ language. The Rosetta Stone comprises three types of writing, each of which recorded what has been entitled The Memphis Decree. Having been the capital city of Ancient Egypt, Memphis was located just south of the Nile Delta, 15 miles to the south of Cairo. The contents of the decree refer to the young pharaoh Ptolemy V, who the Greek text describes as follows: “King Ptolemy, living for ever, the Manifest God whose excellence is fine…” It continues in Egyptian hieroglyphs in the uppermost section; the middle section shows Demotic Egyptian writing (used for document writing rather than writing about sacred subjects); and the lowest third shows Ancient Greek text. The Rosetta Stone is a veritable search engine of the Ancient Egyptian time. Professor Kathryn A Bard has explained that Egyptian writing was borne out of royal administrative requirements. Widely understood to have been written by priests at Memphis, the Stone outlines the numerous benefactions decreed by Ptolemy V during the ninth year of his reign. As such, the text on the Rosetta Stone commemorates Ptolemy’s reign.", "question": "What three types of writing are inscribed on the Rosetta Stone?", "answer": "The Rosetta Stone comprises three types of writing: Egyptian hieroglyphs in the uppermost section, Demotic Egyptian writing in the middle section, and Ancient Greek text in the lowest third."}

At a time of increasing modernisation in the world, hieroglyphs began to exert significant force on the imagination of scholars. In part, hieroglyphs were a language of mysticism. As the British Museum notes about the scholastic culture of the 18th century, “People think that hieroglyphs were symbols recording ideas rather than the sounds of a spoken language.” For the people of Ancient Egypt, their name for hieroglyphic marks was ‘the divine word’. Their belief was that Thoth, the god of wisdom, had bestowed on them the ability to write. Hieroglyph is a word that comes to us from Ancient Greece and it means ‘sacred carvings’. Certainly, plenty of Greek scholars and travellers ventured across the Mediterranean to Egypt. Some scholars have proposed that Egyptian writing began in about 4000 BCE, evolving from writing that was already being practised by that time in Mesopotamia – a region comprising Assyria, Babylonia and Sumer and considered as ‘the cradle of civilisation’. Today, we know this region as Iraq. However, because the written forms are so different, other scholars have proposed that Egyptian hieroglyphs developed independently of Mesopotamian writing. Over 700 signs comprise the building blocks of Egyptian hieroglyphic expression, and the Rosetta Stone allowed scholars to fast evolve their facility to translate the hieroglyphs.

It was Champollion, however, who achieved a full translation of the hieroglyphic material. Champollion’s lecture of 10 May 1831 was a critical moment, in which he observed that: “The translation of [the Greek], which contains a decree issued by the priests of Egypt, who had gathered in Memphis to render homage to King Ptolemy Epiphanes, made it completely certain that the two Egyptian inscriptions on the upper part of the stone contained the truthful expression of the same decree in Egyptian language.” Two decades after its discovery, two scholars undertook the intellectual adventure to unlock the rock Rosetta go-getters Thomas Young Jean-Francois Champollion The decree issued on behalf of Ptolemy V is inscribed on the Rosetta Stone, from top to bottom, in Ancient Egyptian, Demotic and Greek Details from the Book of the Dead, which could be translated once the Rosetta Stone was decoded © Alamy 158 The journey to interpreting the Rosetta Stone Book of Ancient Egypt Summer 1798 Napoleon Bonaparte’s army engages in an attempt to defeat British troops in Egypt.

This type of scholarly competition reflected something of the much broader tension that had existed between France and Britain at the time. In an attempt to weaken Britain, Napoleon had decided on an offensive on British claims in Egypt in order to disrupt Britain’s hugely successful venture in North Africa and emerging connections to India. The artefact was named the Rosetta Stone after El Rashid – the location in the Nile Delta, just about 35 miles north of Alexandria, where it was discovered. And this inconspicuous chunk of granite rock has become a globally recognised archaeological treasure. Relatively swiftly after its discovery, it granted access to the thought- and idea-scape, daily life and religious systems of a culture that has entranced and energised people’s imaginations for centuries. The Rosetta Stone, then, provided something of a quantum leap by allowing scholars to understand with great clarity, and then share, the story of Ancient Egypt. The Stone itself did not narrate the history of Ancient Egypt or anything equally expansive. No: the stone itself records a public decree made by the teenage pharaoh, Ptolemy V. However, this very particular text would eventually allow translators to work out the linguistic system on which Egyptian writing was based. It became the key to unlocking a long-lost corridor of knowledge through to the time of the Ancient Egyptians. We use that term to distinguish the culture from an even older civilisation that had developed around the River Nile. As Dr Penelope Wilson has commented, “Ancient Egyptian is classed by linguists as an Afro-Asiatic language.

Weston’s translation is entirely fascinating, so it’s feasible to quote an excerpt from any part and find interest in it. However, here is a selection from Weston’s translation, as it was published in the RSA’s account: “[Ptolemy] dealt out justice to all, like the great, great Hermes.

It’s a way of encompassing all of the inner, and outer, worlds of human experience. For Ancient Egyptian culture, writing was certainly a way to record the history of the royal family. Writing was committed to both stone and to papyrus, and archaeology has gifted us with what are referred to as the ‘Hekanakhte Papers’, which detail aspects of agricultural life in the form of letters written on papyrus by a farmer to his family during a period when he was away from home. The letters date back to the reign of Senusret I (1971-1926 BCE). A subject typically committed to written memory was spells. Egypt was a culture that, to some degree, combined an affinity for magic with a fascination for the world of reason and evidence-based thought and investigation.

Cursive hieroglyphs were used for religious literature on papyrus and wood. Much of Egypt's ancient history was a mystery until Egyptian hieroglyphs were deciphered with the discovery and help of the Rosetta Stone. Example of Hieroglyphics Although hieroglyphics are Egyptian, the word hieroglyphics is Greek. “Hiero” means “holy” and “glyphics” means “marks” or “writings” – so the word means “holy writings“. THE ROSETTA STONE The breakthrough in deciphering of Hieroglyphics, came only with the discovery of the Rosetta Stone by Napoleon's troops in 1799 (during Napoleon's Egyptian invasion). The stone is written in 2 languages – Egyptian and Greek, using 3 language systems, all of the same text: 1) Hieroglyphics – Egyptian symbols 2) Demotic – which was the ancient Egyptian script 3) Greek translation The Rosetta stone was discovered in 1799 and has been displayed in the British Museum since 1802.
