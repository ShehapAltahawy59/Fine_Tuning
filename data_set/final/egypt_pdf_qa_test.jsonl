C.) the Empire flourished, but was wrecked at last by a combination of adverse influences both within and without.\n<A religious revolution by the young and gifted king\nIkhnaton, caused an internal convulsion such as the country had never before experienced; while the empire in the north gradually disintegrated under the aggressions of the Hittites, who pushed in from\nAsia\nMinor.\nAt the same time in both the northern and southern\nAsiatic dominions of the\nPharaoh, an overflow of\nBeduin immigration, among which were undoubtedly some of the tribes which later coalesced with the\nIsraelites, aggravated the danger, and together with the persistent advance of the\nHittites, finally resulted in the complete dissolution of the\nAsiatic empire of\nEgypt, down to the very frontier of the northeastern\nDelta.\nMeanwhile the internal disorders had caused the fall of the\nHighteenth\nDynasty, an event which terminated the\nFirst\nPeriod of the Empire (1350 B.

Gods, pharaohs,  pyramids, mummification, agriculture and more  helped define the Ancient Egyptians as one of  human history’s most fascinating civilisations.\n13\nKingdoms  of Ancient \nEgypt\nThe  invasions  of Egypt led to  new cultural aspects  being embedded into  society, such as the  use of horses and  chariots\nKingdoms of Ancient Egypt\nThe Old Kingdom\nA time of rebirth, the Old Kingdom saw the introduction  of the irst pharaoh, dynasty and pyramid to the world this time. The Old Kingdom began in about 2686 \nBCE, with the formation of the Third Egyptian \nDynasty. The term ‘Old Kingdom’ was introduced  by 18th-century historians and is used broadly  to signify the first of three peaks of Egyptian  civilisation. Often referred to as the ‘Age of the \nPyramids’, the Old Kingdom saw Egypt nurture  every aspect that would make it great. From the \nThird Dynasty and its first pharaoh, Djoser, to the  apparent last king of the Sixth, Netjerkare Siptah,  the nation was transformed into a cultural and  military powerhouse.\nThe pyramids are a symbol of this era, and the  template for these monumental icons began in  the reign of Djoser. His vizier and closest adviser, \nImhotep (who would be deified in generations  to come as a demigod and god of healing) was  the architect behind the Pyramid of Djoser, and  his designs were a significant leap in engineering  in Ancient Egypt. Prior to Djoser, kings were  buried in rectangular, flat-roofed tombs called  mastabas, but the Third Dynasty’s founder desired  immortality in death by means of a tomb worthy  of a divine ruler. Imhotep’s revolutionary design,  stacking squared versions of mastabas on top of \nP rior to the Old Kingdom, in an era known as  the Predynastic, Prehistoric or Protodynastic \nPeriod, Egypt was going through something  of a transformation. The nation was divided  into colonies, each with their own lords and  rulers. The north and south of the country were  also distinct in both practices and culture, with \nHierakonpolis the capital of the south and Bes the  capital of the north.\nExcavations over the last century have radically  changed the way we view Egypt prior to the Old", "question": "By whom and in which century was the term 'Old Kingdom' introduced?", "answer": "The term 'Old Kingdom' was introduced by 18th-century historians."}

{"context": "Khufu, the second pharaoh of the \nFourth Dynasty, was the man to create  a monument so grand it would eventually be  named one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient \nWorld: the Great Pyramid of Giza. Built over a  two-decade period, the 146.5-metre-high structure  was a feat of engineering that put even Imhotep’s \nStep Pyramid in Sakkara to shame. Giza would  become the site of many more pyramids and  temples, known as the Giza Necropolis. The Giza \n15\nPyramid became the pinnacle of pyramid design  in Egypt and it would remain the tallest man-made  structure for a staggering 3,800 years. It served as  a testament to the power of the pharaohs and the  enduring potency of the many Egyptian gods. \nThe Fifth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt (2498 BCE – \n2345 BCE) saw an evolution of theological practices  across the nation, with certain cults growing in  prominence (gods rose and fell in popularity, and  usually those favoured by a particular dynasty  or geographically important location  survived obscurity). The Cult of Ra \n(god of the noon sun) and the Cult  of Osiris (god of the afterlife)  rose significantly in popularity  during this period of time.\nThe Egyptian economy was  also booming, with the influx  of goods like ebony, gold, myrrh  and frankincense growing  all the time. The Egyptians  pushed their trading boundaries  even further with agreements with \nLebanon and modern-day Somalia. In  short, it was a time of enterprise without the fear  of invasion or war. This economic strength bled  into the Sixth Dynasty (2345 BCE – 2181 BCE), as  did the growing popularity of the inscription of  spells and incantations inside burial chambers and  tombs.

After witnessing the rise and negative  influence of the church of Amun, Amenhotep IV (assuming  the new title Akhenaten) drains the treasury, neglects his  people and forces the nation to worship a single god.\nAmun vs Aten\nAs powerful as King Amenhotep III was, another  power was growing in the realm, one that had been  there long before he ascended to the throne: the  church of Amun. Ancient Egypt was a polytheistic  kingdom, worshipping multiple gods, much like the \nNorse or the Greeks. However, it wasn’t uncommon  for one god or goddess to rise in prominence if  favoured by a particular monarch – the Thebans  of the 11th Dynasty had chosen Amun, and his  prominence had risen even higher following the  expulsion of the Hyksos. The church had grown with  him and now controlled as much land and wealth as  the king, often attempting to influence politics within \nAmenhotep III’s court.\nAs a result, the king began paying tribute to the  minor god Aten in an attempt to draw influence  away from the bothersome church.

Specifically, how were the  massive two-ton blocks placed 480 feet  above the desert floor? \nA French architect named Jean-Pierre Houdin  has posits a theory to explain the mystery. Houdin  has devoted his time to studying the Great Pyramid  and creating graphical models using 3D software. He  proposes that an external ramp was built to haul the  rocks – pulled by means of ropes – for the first 60  metres or so of the pyramid. Then an internal ramp  was built to continue hauling rocks up. It is a mile- long, narrow structure spiralling inside the pyramid,  much like the ramps in a parking garage. To allow  for men to haul the stones, the ramp is at a seven per  cent slope. Somehow it has remained hidden inside  the pyramid since its completion 4,500 years ago.\nBut how would men hauling the blocks up the  ramp make the turn at each corner of the ramp? \nThey would need a place to stand in front of the  blocks. Houdin believes that each corner was  temporarily left open, with a notch of about three  square metres. Wooden cranes were stationed in  each open space to lift the blocks onto the next level  of the ramp. Later the notches were filled in. \nThere is some evidence that an internal ramp  exists at the Great Pyramid. In 1986, a team of \nFrench scientists used microgravimetrics to  survey the pyramid. They were looking for hidden  chambers by checking for areas of low density,  which would indicate open spaces. The team  did find one new chamber that was filled with  sand.

Those who  went wading through its cool waters, most notably  along the irrigation channels, were in danger of  crossing paths with parasites like the Schistosoma  worm.

The Egyptian terrain was rich  in a range of minerals and resources, and gold was one  such naturally occurring treasure. As far back as the  fourth millennium BCE, the Egyptian people were  beginning to access gold via alluvial deposits. Then, as  of around 3100 BCE, engineers developed efficient and  productive mining operations that were located in the  mountain range east of Coptos and also in the south  in Nubia. Consistent with so much else in their sense  of the immediate and the eternal, the Ancient Egyptians  connected the real practicalities of the world with their  religious system: they considered gold to be the flesh of Ra, the \nSun god.

At  a time of increasing modernisation in the world,  hieroglyphs began to exert significant force on the  imagination of scholars. In part, hieroglyphs were  a language of mysticism. As the British Museum  notes about the scholastic culture of the 18th  century, “People think that hieroglyphs were  symbols recording ideas rather than the  sounds of a spoken language.”\nFor the people of Ancient Egypt,  their name for hieroglyphic marks  was ‘the divine word’. Their  belief was that Thoth, the god of  wisdom, had bestowed on them  the ability to write. Hieroglyph  is a word that comes to us from \nAncient Greece and it means \n‘sacred carvings’.
