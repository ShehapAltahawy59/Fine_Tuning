The deposits which have formed the Delta, are very deep, and have slowly risen over the sites of the many ancient cities which once flourished there. The old swamps which must once have rendered the regions of the northern Delta a vast morass, have been gradually filled up, and the fringe of marshes pushed further out. They undoubtedly occupied in antiquity a much larger proportion of the Delta than they do now.

The cliffs on either hand are usually but a few hundred feet in height, but here and there they rise into almost mountains of a thousand feet (Fig. 3). They are of course flanked by the deserts through which the Nile has cut its way. On the west the Libyan Desert or the Great Sahara rolls in illimitable, desolate hills of sand, gravel and rock, from six hundred and fifty to a thousand feet above the Nile. Its otherwise waterless expanse is broken only by an irregular line of oases, or watered depressions, roughly parallel with the river, and doubtless owing their springs and wells to infiltration of the Nile waters. The largest of these depressions is situated so close to the valley that the rock wall which once separated them has broken down, pro- ducing the fertile Fayum, watered by the Bahr Yusuf. Otherwise the western desert held no economic resources for the use of the early Nile-dwellers. The eastern or Arabian Desert is somewhat less inhospitable, and capable of yield- ing a scanty subsistence to wandering tribes of Ababdeh. A range of granite mountains parallel with the coast of the Red Sea contains gold-bearing quartz veins, and here and there other gold-producing mountains lie between the Nile and the Red", "question": "What historical economic resources were available to the early Nile-dwellers from the western and eastern deserts?", "answer": "The western desert historically held no economic resources for the early Nile-dwellers, while the eastern or Arabian Desert was less inhospitable and contained gold-bearing quartz veins."}

Approaching it, the one from the south and the other from the north, two great river valleys traverse this desert; in Asia, the Tigro- Kuphrates valley; in Africa that of the Nile. It is in these two valleys that the career of man may be traced from the rise of European civilization back to a remoter age than anywhere else on earth; and it is from these two cradles of the human race that the influences which emanated from their highly developed but differing cultures, can now be more and more clearly traced as we discern them converging upon the early civilization of Asia Minor and southern Europe. 3 4 A HISTORY OF EGYPT The Nile, which created the valley home of the early Egyptians, rises three degrees south of the equator, and flowing into the Mediterranean at over thirty one and a half degrees north latitude, it attains a length of some four thou- sand miles, and vies with the greatest rivers of the world in length, if not in volume. In its upper course the river, emerging from the lakes of equatorial Africa, is known as the White Nile. Just south of north latitude sixteen at Khar- tum, about thirteen hundred and fifty miles from the sea, it receives from the east an affluent known as the Blue Nile, which is a considerable mountain torrent, rising in the lofty highlands of Abyssinia. One hundred and forty miles below the union of the two Niles the stream is joined by its only other tributary, the Atbara, which is a freshet not unlike the Blue Nile. It is at Khartum, or just below it, that the river enters the table land of Nubian sandstone, underlying the Great Sahara. Here it winds on its tortuous course between the desert hills (Fig. 84), where it returns upon itself, often flowing due south, until after it has finally pushed through to the north, its course describes a vast S.

Had the Euphrates finally found its way into the Mediter- ranean, toward which, indeed, it seems to have started, both the early civilizations, to which we refer, might then have been included in the Mediterranean basin. As it is, the scene of early oriental history does not fall entirely within that basin, but must be designated as the eastern Mediterranean region.

In six different places throughout this region the current has hitherto failed to erode a perfect channel through the stubborn stone, and these extended interruptions, where the rocks are piled in scattered and irregular masses in the stream, are known as the cataracts of the Nile; although there is no great and sudden fall such as that of our cataract at Niagara (Fig. 1). These rocks interfere with navigation most seriously in the region of the first, second and fourth cataracts ; otherwise the river is navigable almost throughout its entire course. At Elephantine it passes the granite bar- rier which there thrusts up its rough shoulder, forming the first cataract, and thence emerges upon an unobstructed course to the sea. It is the valley below the first cataract which constituted Egypt proper. The reason for the change which here gives the river a free course is the disappearance of the sandstone, sixty eight miles below the cataract, at Hdfu, where the num- THE LAND 5 mulitic limestone which forms the northern desert plateau, offers the stream an easier task in the erosion of its bed. It has thus produced a vast cafion or trench (Figs. 3 and 7), eut across the eastern end of the Sahara to the northern sea. From cliff to cliff, the valley varies in width, from ten or twelve, to some thirty one miles. The floor of the cafion is eovered with black, alluvial deposits, through which the river winds northward. It cuts a deep channel through the alluvium, flowing with a speed of about three miles an hour; in width it only twice attains a maximum of eleven hundred yards. On the west the Bahr Yusuf, a second, minor chan- nel some two hundred miles long, leaves the main stream near Siut and flows into the Fayum. In antiquity it flowed thence into a canal known as the ‘‘North,’’ which passed northward west of Memphis and reached the sea by the site of later Alexandria.‘ A little over a hundred miles from the sea the main stream enters the broad triangle, with apex at the south, which the Greeks so graphically called the “‘Delta.’’ This is of course a bay of prehistoric ages, which has been gradually filled up by the river.

The system was not fully developed until the advent of a second Theban family, the Twelfth Dynasty, the founder of which, Amenemhet I, probably usurped the throne. For over two hundred years (2000-1788 B. C.) this powerful line of kings ruled a feudal state. This feudal age is the classic period of Egyptian history. Literature flourished, the orthography of the language was for the first time regulated, poetry had already reached a highly artistic structure, the earliest known literature of entertainment was produced, sculpture and architecture were rich and prolific, and the industrial arts surpassed all previous attainments. The internal resources of the country were elaborately devel- oped, especially by close attention to the Nile and the inun- dation. Enormous hydraulic works reclaimed large tracts of cultivable domain in the Fayum, in the vicinity of which the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty, the Amenemhets and the Sesostrises, lived. Abroad the exploitation of the mines in Sinai was now carried on by the constant labour of permanent colonies there, with temples, fortifications and reservoirs for the water supply. A plundering campaign was carried into Syria, trade and intercourse with its Semitic tribes were con- stant, and an interchange of commodities with the early Mycenzan centres of civilization in the northern Mediter- ranean is evident. Traffic with Punt and the southern coasts of the Red Sea continued, while in Nubia the country between 11 5S. PRELIMINARY SURVEY 17 the first and second cataracts, loosely controlled in the Sixth Dynasty, was now conquered and held tributary by the Pharaoh, so that the gold mines on the east of it were a con- stant resource of his treasury. The fall of the Twelfth Dynasty in 1788 B. C. was followed by a second period of disorganization and obscurity, as the feudatories struggled for the crown. Now and then an aggressive and able ruler gained the ascendency for a brief reign, and under one of these the subjugation of Upper Nubia was carried forward to a point above the third cat- aract; but his conquest perished with him. After possibly a century of such internal conflict, the country was entered and appropriated by a line of rulers from Asia, who had seemingly already gained a wide dominion there.", "question": "What historical event followed the collapse of the Twelfth Dynasty, and what new group of rulers emerged in Egypt after this period?", "answer": "The fall of the Twelfth Dynasty in 1788 B.C. led to a period of disorganization and obscurity. After approximately a century of internal conflict, the country was subsequently entered and appropriated by a line of rulers from Asia."}
{"context": "Phcenicia and the Islands of the North, while in the south, the Pharaoh’s fleets penetrated to the Somali coast on the Red Sea; and in Nubia his envoys were strong enough to exercise a loose sovereignty over the lower country, and by tireless expeditions to keep open the trade routes leading to the Sudan. In the Sixth Dynasty (2625-2475 B. C.) the local governors of the central administration, who had already gained hereditary hold upon their offices in the Fifth Dynasty (2750-2625 B. C.), were able to assert them- selves as landed barons and princes, no longer mere func- tionaries of the crown. They thus prepared the way for an age of feudalism. The growing power of the new landed nobility finally caused the fall of the Pharaonic house, and after the close of the Sixth Dynasty, about 2400 B. C., the supremacy of Memphis waned. In the internal confusion which followed, we can discern nothing of Manetho’s ephemeral Seventh and Highth Dynasties at Memphis, which lasted not more than thirty years; but with the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties the nobles of Heracleopolis gained the throne, which was occupied by eighteen successive kings of the line. It is now that Thebes first appears as the seat of a powerful family of princes, by whom the Heracleopolitans and the power of the North are gradually overcome till the South triumphs. 16 A HISTORY OF EGYPT The exact lapse of time from the fall of the Old Kingdom to the triumph of the South is at present indeterminable, but it may be estimated roughly at two hundred and seventy five to three hundred years,! with a margin of uncertainty of possibly a century either way. With the restoration of a united Egypt under the Theban princes of the Eleventh Dynasty about 2160 B. C., the issue of the tendencies already discernible at the close of the Old Kingdom is clearly visible. Throughout the land the local princes and barons are firmly seated in their domains, and with these hereditary feudatories the Pharaoh must now reckon. The system was not fully developed until the advent of a second Theban family, the Twelfth Dynasty, the founder of which, Amenemhet I, probably usurped the throne.

The restoration of a united Egypt under the Theban princes of the Eleventh Dynasty around 2160 B.C. marked the beginning of Egypt's feudal age, which was fully developed by the Twelfth Dynasty."}

A vast and elaborate system of irrigation canals and reservoirs first receives the flood, which is then allowed to escape into the fields as needed. Here it rests long enough to deposit its burden of rich, black earth from the upper reaches of the Blue Nile. At such times the appearance of the country is picturesque in the extreme, the glistening surface of the waters being dotted here and there by the vivid green of the waving palm groves, which mark the villages, now accessible only along the dykes _ belonging to the irrigation system (Fig. 2). Thus year by year, the soil which would otherwise become impoverished in the elements necessary to the production of such prodi- gious harvests, is invariably replenished with fresh resources. As the river sinks below the level of the fields again, it is necessary to raise the water from the canals by artificial means, in order to carry on the constant irrigation of the growing crops in the outlying fields, which are too high to be longer refreshed by absorption from the river (Fig. 6).! Thus a genial and generous, but exacting soil, demanded for its cultivation the development of a high degree of skill *The device used (called a “shadfif”) resembles the well-sweep of our grandfathers. Fig. 6 shows the leathern bucket suspended from one end of the sweep, while at the other end a huge lump of dried mud serves as a counter- poise. When the water is very low, as many as three or even four such “ shadtifs ” are necessary to raise the water from level to level until that of the field is reached.

THE LAND 11 and when he broke through the barriers which separated him from Asia, and reached the Euphrates, he called it ‘‘that inverted water which goes down stream in going up stream”’ (southward).‘ For him the world consisted of the ‘‘ Black Land’’ and the ‘‘ Red Land,”’ the black soil of the Nile valley and the reddish surface of the desert; or again of the ‘‘plain’’ and the ‘‘highlands,’’ meaning the level Nile ‘‘bottoms’’ and the high desert plateau. ‘‘Highlander’’ was synonymous with foreigner, to ‘‘go up’’ was to leave the valley, while to “‘descend’’ was the customary term for returning home from abroad. ‘The illimitable solitudes of the desert, which thrust itself thus insistently upon his vision and his whole economy of life, and formed his horizon toward both suns, tinctured with sombreness his views of the great gods who ruled such a world. Such was in brief the scene in which developed the people of the Nile, whose culture dominated the basin of the eastern Mediterranean in the age when Europe was emerging into the secondary stages of civilization, and coming into intimate contact with the culture of the early east. Nowhere on earth have the witnesses of a great, but now extinct civilization, been so plentifully preserved as along the banks of the Nile. Even in the Delta, where the storms of war beat more fiercely than in the valley above, and where the slow accumulations from the yearly flood have gradually entombed them, the splendid cities of the Pharaohs have left great stretches, cumbered with enormous blocks of granite, limestone and sandstone, shattered obelisks, and massive pylon bases, to proclaim the wealth and power of forgotten ages; while an ever growing multitude of modern visitors are drawn to the upper valley by the colossal ruins that greet the wondering traveller almost at every bend in the stream.", "question": "What types of historical ruins and remnants of their civilization are noted as being well-preserved along the Nile?", "answer": "Witnesses of ancient Egyptian civilization, such as enormous granite, limestone, and sandstone blocks, shattered obelisks, and massive pylon bases, have been plentifully preserved along the banks of the Nile, even in the Delta."}

The natural boundaries of Egypt, however, always presented sufficiently effective bar- riers to would-be invaders, to enable the natives slowly to assimilate the new comers, without being displaced. It will be evident that the remarkable shape of the country must powerfully influence its political development. Except in the Delta it was but a narrow line, some seven hundred and fifty miles long. Straggling its slender length along the river, and sprawling out into the Delta, it totally lacked the compactness necessary to stable political organization. A given locality has neighbours on only two sides, north and south, and these their shortest boundaries; local feeling was strong, local differences were persistent, and a man of the Delta could hardly understand the speech of a man of the first cataract region. It was only the ease of communication afforded by the river which in any degree neutralized the effect of the country’s remarkable length. The wealth of commerce which the river served to carry, it was equally instrumental in producing. While the climate of the country is not rainless, yet the rare showers of the south, often separated by intervals of years, and even the more frequent rains of the Delta, are totally insufficient to maintain the processes of agriculture. The marvellous pro- ductivity of the Egyptian soil is due to the annual inundation of the river, which is caused by the melting of the snows, 8 A HISTORAS OF EGYPT and by the spring rains at the sources of the Blue Nile. Freighted with the rich loam of the Abyssinian highlands, the rushing waters of the spring freshet hurry down the Nubian valley, and a slight rise is discernible at the first cataract in the early part of June. The flood swells rapidly and steadily, and although the increase is usually inter- rupted for nearly a month from the end of September on, it is usually resumed again, and the maximum level con- tinues until the end of October or into November. The waters in the region of the first cataract are then nearly fifty feet higher than at low water; while at Cairo the rise is about half that at the cataract. A vast and elaborate system of irrigation canals and reservoirs first receives the flood, which is then allowed to escape into the fields as needed.", "question": "How did Egypt's unique geographical shape historically impact its political development and internal coherence?", "answer": "The narrow, elongated shape of Egypt, stretching some 750 miles along the Nile and sprawling into the Delta, lacked compactness, which historically fostered strong local feeling and persistent local differences.

The other natural resources of the valley we shall be better able to trace as we follow their exploitation in the course of the historical development. In climate Egypt is a veritable paradise, drawing to its shores at the present day an ever increasing number of winter guests. The air of Egypt is essentially that of the deserts within which it lies, and such is its purity and dryness, that even an excessive degree of heat occasions but shght discomfort, owing to the fact that the moisture of the body is dried up almost as fast as it is exhaled. The mean temperature of the Delta in winter is 56° Fahrenheit, and in the valley above it is ten degrees higher. In summer the mean in the Delta is 83°; and although the summer tempera- ture in the valley is sometimes as high as 122°, the air is far from the oppressiveness accompanying the same degree of heat in other lands. The nights even in summer are always cool, and the vast expanses of vegetation appreciably reduce the temperature. In winter just before dawn the extreme cold is surprising, as contrasted with the genial warmth of midday at the same season. To the absence of rain we have already adverted.

They were nevertheless beaten back by Merneptah. After another period of internal confusion and usurpation, during which the Nineteenth Dynasty fell (1205 B. C.), Ramses III, whose father, Setnakht founded the Twentieth Dynasty (1200-1090 B. C.), was able to main- tain the Empire at the same limits, against the invasions of restless northern tribes, who crushed the Hittite power; and also against repeated immigrations of the Libyans. With his death (1167 B. C.) the empire, with the exception of Nubia which was still held, rapidly fell to pieces. Thus, about the middle of the twelfth century B. C. the Second Period of the imperial age closed with the total dissolution of the Asiatic dominions. Under a series of weak Ramessids, the country rapidly — declined and fell a prey first to the powerful high priests of Amon, who were obliged almost immediately to yield to stronger Ramessid rivals in the Delta at Tanis, forming the Twenty First Dynasty (1090-945 B. C.). By the middle of the tenth century B. C. the mercenaries, who had formed the armies of the second imperial period, had founded pow- erful families in the Delta cities, and among these the Libyans were now supreme. Sheshonk I,a Libyan mercenary commander, gained the throne as the founder of the Twenty Second Dynasty in 945 B. C. and the country enjoyed transient prosperity, while Sheshonk even attempted the recovery of Palestine. But the family was unable to control the turbulent mercenary commanders, now established as dynasties in the larger Delta towns, and the country grad- ually relapsed into a series of military principalities in constant warfare with each other. Through the entire Libyan period of the Twenty Second, Twenty Third and Twenty Fourth Dynasties (945-712 B.

Even in the vast morass of the Delta, malaria is practically unknown. Thus, lying just outside of the tropics, Egypt enjoyed a mild climate of unsurpassed salubrity, devoid of the harshness of a northern winter, but at the same time sufficiently cool to escape those enervating influences inherent in tropical conditions. The prospect of this contracted valley spread out before the Nile dweller, was in antiquity, as it is to-day, somewhat monotonous. The level Nile bottoms, the gift of the river, clad in rich green, shut in on either hand by the yellow cliffs, are unrelieved by any elevations or by any forests, save the occasional groves of graceful palms, which fringe the river banks or shade the villages of sombre mud huts (Fig. 4), with now and then a sycamore, a tamarisk or an acacia. <A network of irrigation canals traverses the country in every direction like a vast arterial system. The sands of the deso- late wastes which lie behind the cafion walls, drift in athwart the cliffs, and often invade the green fields so that one may stand with one foot in the verdure of the valley, and the other in the desert sand. Thus sharply defined was the Egyptian’s world: a deep and narrow valley of unparalleled fertility, winding between lifeless deserts, furnishing a remarkable environment, not to be found elsewhere in all the world. Such surroundings reacted powerfully upon the mind and thought of the Egyptian, conditioning and deter- mining his idea of the world and his notion of the mysterious powers which ruled it. The river, the dommant feature of his valley, determined his notion of direction: his words for north and south were ‘‘down-stream’’ and ‘‘up-stream’’; a Fic. 3.—LOOKING ACROSS THE NILE TO THE WESTERN CLIFFS NEAR THEBES.

In the plenitude of its splendour, much of it thus survived into the classic age of European civilization, and hence it was, that as Egypt was gradually overpowered and absorbed by the western world, the currents of life from west and east commingled here, as they have never done else- where. Both in the Nile valley and beyond it, the west thus felt the full impact of Egyptian civilization for many centuries, and gained from it all that its manifold culture had to contribute. The career which made Egypt so rich a heritage of alien peoples, and a legacy so valuable to all later ages, we shall endeavour to trace in the ensuing chapters. CHAPTER II PRELIMINARY SURVEY, CHRONOLOGY AND DOCUMENTARY SOURCES A RAPID survey of the purely external features which serve to demark the great epochs in the career of the Nile valley people, will enable us the more intelligently to study those epochs in detail, as we meet them in the course of our progress. In such a survey, we sweep our eyes down a period of four thousand years of human history, from a time when the only civilization known in the basin of the Mediter- ranean is slowly dawning among a primitive people on the shores of the Nile. We can cast but a brief glance at the outward events which characterized each great period, espe- cially noting how foreign peoples are gradually drawn within the circle of Egyptian intercourse from age to age, and reciprocal influences ensue; until in the thirteenth century B. C. the peoples of southern Europe, long discernible in their material civilization, emerge in the written documents of Egypt for the first time in history.

{"context": "The Delta was, throughout the historic age, open to inroads of the Libyans who dwelt upon the west of it; and the constant influx of people from this source gave the western Delta a distinctly Libyan character which it preserved even down to the time of Herodotus. At the earliest moment when the monuments enable us to discern the conditions in the Delta, the Pharaoh is contending with the Libyan invaders, and the earlier kingdom of the North will there- fore have been strongly Libyan, if indeed it did not owe its origin to this source. The temple at Sais, in the western Delta, the chief centre of Libyan influence in Egypt, bore the name ‘‘ House of the King of Lower Egypt’’ (the Delta), 32 A HISTORY OF EGYPT and the emblem of Neit, its chief goddess was tattooed by the Libyans upon their arms. It may possibly therefore have been an early residence of a Libyan king of the Delta. Reliefs recently discovered in Sahure’s pyramid-temple at Abusir show four Libyan chiefs wearing on their brows the royal urzeus serpent of the Pharaohs, to whom it there- fore descended from some such early Libyan king of the Delta. As its coat of arms or symbol the Northern Kingdom employed a tuft of papyrus plant, which grew so plentifully in its marshes as to be distinctive of it. The king himself was designated by a bee, and wore upon his head a red crown, both in colour and shape peculiar to his kingdom. All of these symbols are very common in later hieroglyphic. Red was the distinctive colour of the northern kingdom and its treasury was called the ‘‘Red House.’’ Unfortunately the Delta is so deeply overlaid with deposits of Wile mud, that the material remains of its earliest civili- zation are buried forever from our reach. That civiliza- tion was probably earlier and more advanced than that of the valley above. Already in the forty third century B.

The art of the prolific potter was obliged to give way slowly to the artificer in stone, who finally produced excel- lent stone vessels, which he gradually improved toward the end of predynastic period, when his bowls and jars in the hardest stones, like the diorites and porphyries, display mag- nificent work.

His native city was Thinis, an obscure place in the vicinity of Abydos, which was not near enough to the centre of his new kingdom to serve as his residence, and we can easily credit the nar- rative of Herodotus that he built a great dam, diverting the course of the Nile above the site of Memphis that he might gain room there for acity. This stronghold, perhaps not yet called Memphis, was probably known as the ‘‘ White Wall,”’ in reference of course to the White Kingdom, whose power it represented. If we may believe the tradition of Herodotus’ time, it was from this place, situated so favourably on the border between the two kingdoms, that Menes probably gov- erned the new nation which he had created. He carried his arms also southward against northern Nubia,! which then ex- tended below the first cataract as far northward as the nome of Kdfu. According to the tradition of Manetho, he was blessed with a long reign, and the memory of his great achievement was imperishable, as we have seen. He was buried in Upper Egypt, either at Abydos near his native Thinis, or some distance above it near the modern village of Negadeh, where a large brick tomb, probably his, still survives. In it and similar tombs of his successors at Abydos, written monuments of his reign have been found, and the reader may see in the accompanying illustration, even a piece of his royal adornments, bearing his name, which this ancient founder of the Egyptian state wore upon his person (Fig. 13).

If this be true, there were probably some twenty such states distributed along the river in Upper Egypt. However this may be, these people were already at a stage of civilization where considerable towns appear and city-states, as in Babylon, must have developed, each with its chief or dynast, its local god, worshipped in a crude sanc- tuary; and its market to which the tributary, outlying coun- try was attracted. The long process by which such commu- nities grew up can be only surmised from the analogy of similar developments elsewhere, but the small kingdoms and city-states, out of which the nation was ultimately consoli- dated, do not fall within the historic age, as in Babylon. The gradual fusion which finally merged these petty states into two kingdoms: one in the Delta, and the other com- prising the states of the valley above, is likewise a process of which we shall never know the course. Of its heroes and its conquerors, its wars and conquests, not an echo will ever reach us; nor is there the slightest indication of the length of time consumed by this process. It will hardly have been concluded, however, before 4000 B. C. Our knowledge of the two kingdoms which emerged at the end of this long prehistoric age, is but slightly more satisfactory. The Delta was, throughout the historic age, open to inroads of the Libyans who dwelt upon the west of it; and the constant influx of people from this source gave the western Delta a distinctly Libyan character which it preserved even down to the time of Herodotus. At the earliest moment when the monuments enable us to discern the conditions in the Delta, the Pharaoh is contending with the Libyan invaders, and the earlier kingdom of the North will there- fore have been strongly", "question": "How might prehistoric communities in Egypt be historically linked to later administrative divisions?", "answer": "Traces of prehistoric communities in Egypt might be recognized in the later administrative or feudal divisions of the country, known as nomes by the Greeks."}

The kingdom of Upper Egypt was more distinctively Egyptian than that of the Delta. It had its capital at Nekheb, modern El Kab, and its standard or symbol was a lily plant, while another southern plant served as the ensign of the king, who was further distinguished by a tall white crown, white being the colour of the Southern Kingdom.

But at both capitals the hawk-god Horus was worshipped as the distinctive patron deity of both kings. The people of the time believed in a life hereafter, subject to wants of the same nature as those of the present life. Their cemeteries are widely distributed along the margin of the desert in Upper Egypt, and of late years thousands of interments have been excavated.

There was a body of fiscal officials, whose seals we find upon payments of naturalia to the royal tombs, impressed upon the clay jar-sealings; while a fragment of a scribe’s accounts evidently belonging to such an adminis- tration, was found in the Abydos royal tombs. The endow- ment of these tombs with a regularly paid income clearly indicates an orderly and effective fiscal organization, of which several offices, like the ‘‘provision office,’’ are men- tioned on the seals. This department of the state was but a union of the two treasuries of the old kingdoms of the North and South, the ‘‘Red House’’ and the ‘‘White House’’; hence we find among the seals in the royal tombs the ‘‘Vineyard of the Red House of the King’s Hstate.’’ Evidently the union of the two kingdoms consisted only in the person of the king.

From the place in which they are found, they are usually called the ‘‘Pyramid Texts.”’ Many of these texts grew up in the predynastic age and some have therefore been altered to accommodate them to the Osiris faith, with which they originally had no connec- tion—a process which has of course resulted in inextricable confusion of originally differing mortuary beliefs. So insistent a belief or set of beliefs in a life beyond the grave necessarily brought with it a mass of mortuary usages with which in the earliest period of EKgypt’s career we have already gained some acquaintance. It is evident that how- ever persistently the Egyptian transferred the life of the departed to some distant region, far from the tomb where 1 Thid. 77, 253, 330, 338, 357. 5T, 331. *See Erman, Handbuch. 68 A HISTORY OF EGYPT the body lay, he was never able to detach the future life entirely from the body. It is evident that he could conceive of no survival of the dead without it. Gradually he had developed a more and more pretentious and a safer repos- itory for his dead, until, as we have seen, it had become a vast and massive structure of stone. In all the world no such colossal tombs as the pyramids are to be found; while the tombs of the nobles grouped about have in the Old Kingdom become immense masonry structures, which but a few cen- turies before, a king would have been proud to own.

{"context": "King Semerkhet, early in the dynastic age, and probably during the First Dynasty, car- ried on mining operations in the copper regions of the Sinaitic peninsula, in the Wadi Maghara. His expedition was exposed to the depredations of the wild tribes of Beduin, who already in this remote age, peopled those dis- tricts; and he recorded his punishment of them in a relief upon the rocks of the Wadi (Fig. 28).’ Usephais, of the First Dynasty, must have conducted similar operations there; for he has left a memorial of his victory over the same tribes in a scene carved upon an ivory tablet, showing him striking down a native whom he has forced to the knees (Fig. 26). It is accompanied by the inscription: ‘‘ First occurrence of smiting the Easterners.’’ This designation of the event as the ‘‘first occurrence’’ would indicate that it was a customary thing for the kings of the time to chastise these barbarians, and that therefore he was expecting a ‘‘second occurrence,’’ as a matter of course. A ‘‘smiting of the Troglodytes,’’ the same people, recorded on the Pa- lermo Stone? in the First Dynasty, doubtless falls in the reign of king Miebis. Indeed there are indications that the kings of this time maintained foreign relations with far remoter peoples. In their tombs have been found fragments of a peculiar, non-Egyptian pottery, closely resembling the 1 Weill, Rev. Arch., 1903, II, p. 231; and Recueil des Inser.

If this pottery was placed in these tombs at the time of the original burials, there were commercial relations between Egypt and the northern Mediterranean peoples in the fourth millennium before Christ. Besides the aggressive foreign policy in the east, and this foreign connection in the north, we find that an occasional campaign was necessary to restrain the Libyans on the west. In the temple at Hiera- conpolis Narmer left an ivory cylinder’ commemorating his victory over them, an event which is doubtless to be con- nected with the same king’s chastisement of the Libyan nomes in the western Delta, to which we have already adverted.

Here, according to a very early belief, dwelt the dead, whose king was Osiris. He had succeeded the sun-god as king on earth, aided in his government by his faithful sister-wife, Isis. A bene- factor of men, and beloved as a righteous ruler, he was nevertheless craftily misled and slain by his brother Set. When, after great tribulation, Isis had gained possession of her lord’s body, she was assisted in preparing it for burial by one of the old gods of the nether world, Anubis, the jackal-god, who thereafter became the god of embalmment. So powerful were the charms now uttered by Isis over the body of her dead husband that it was reanimated, and regained the use of its limbs; and although it was impos. sible for the departed god to resume his earthly life, he passed down in triumph as a living king, to become lord of the nether world. Isis later gave birth to a son, Horus, whom she secretly reared among the marshy fastnesses of the Delta as the avenger of his father.", "question": "Who was historically believed to be the king of the nether world in ancient Egypt, and what was his mythological narrative?", "answer": "According to a very early belief, Osiris was the king of the nether world.

Another, perhaps a private citizen, says, ‘‘Never was I beaten in the presence of any official since my birth; never did I take the property of any man by violence; I was doer of that which pleased all men.’’* Nor was it always nega- tive virtues which they claimed; a noble of Upper Egypt at the close of the Fifth Dynasty says, ‘‘I gave bread to the hungry of the Cerastes-Mountain (the district he governed) ; * Pyramid of Pepi I, 400; Mernere 570, Erman, Zeitschrift fiir Aegyptische Sprache, XXXI, 76-77. 21, 252. - 8 I, 279. 5 66 A HISTORY OF EGYPT I clothed him who was naked therein. . . . I never oppressed one in possession of his property, so that he complained of me because of it to the god of my city; never was there one fearing because of one stronger than he, so that he com- plained because of it to the god.’’’ Into these early beliefs, with which Osiris originally had nothing to do, the myth which told of his death and depar- ture into the nether world, now entered, to become the dominating element in Egyptian mortuary belief. He had become the ‘‘first of those in the west’’ and ‘‘king of the glorified’’; every soul that suffered the fate of Osiris might also experience his restoration to life; might indeed become an Osiris. So they said: ‘‘As Osiris lives, so shall he also live; as Osiris died not, so shall he also not die; as Osiris perished not, so shall he also not perish.’” As the limbs of Osiris were again imbued with life, so shall the gods raise him up and put him among the gods. ‘‘The door of heaven is open to thee, and the great bolts are drawn back for thee. Thou findest Re standing there; he takes thee by the hand and leads thee into the holy place of heaven, and sets thee upon the throne of Osiris, upon this thy brazen throne, that thou mayest reign over the glorified. . . .The servants of the god stand behind thee and the nobles of the god stand before thee and cry, ‘Come thou god!

{"context": "The service of the divinity who dwelt here consisted simply in furnishing him with those things which formed the necessities and luxuries of an Egyptian of wealth and rank at that time: plentiful food and drink, fine clothing, music and the dance. The source of these offerings was the income from an endowment of lands established by the throne, as well as various contributions from the royal rey- enues in grain, wine, oil, honey and the like.1_ These contribu- tions to the comfort and happiness of the lord of the temple, while probably originally offered without ceremony, gradually became the occasion of an elaborate ritual which was essen- tially alike in all temples. Outside in the forecourt was the great altar, where the people gathered on feast days, when they were permitted to share the generous food offerings, which ordinarily were eaten by the priests and servants of the temple, after they had been presented to the god. These feasts, besides those marking times and seasons, were fre- quently commemorations of some important event in the story or myth of the god, and on such occasions the priests brought forth the image in a portable shrine, having the form of a small Nile boat. The earliest priesthood was but an incident in the duties of the local noble, who was the head of the priests in the community; but the exalted position of the Pharaoh as the nation developed, made him the sole official servant of the gods, and there arose at the beginning of the nation’s his- tory a state form of religion, in which the Pharaoh played the supreme role. In theory, therefore, it was he alone who worshipped the gods; in fact, however, he was of necessity represented in each of the many temples of the land by a high priest, by whom all offerings were presented ‘‘for the sake of the life, prosperity and health’’ of the Pharaoh. Some of these high priesthoods were of very ancient origin: particularly that of Heliopolis, whose incumbent was called 17, 153-167; 213. EARLY RELIGION 63 “‘Great Seer’’; while he of Ptah at Memphis was called ‘‘Great Chief of Artificers.’’ Both positions demanded two incumbents at once and were usually held by men of high rank. The incumbents of the other high priesthoods of later origin all bore the simple title of ‘‘overseer or chief of priests.’’", "question": "What were the historical titles and characteristics of the high priesthoods in Heliopolis and Memphis?", "answer": "The high priest of Heliopolis was historically called \"Great Seer,\" while the high priest of Ptah at Memphis was known as \"Great Chief of Artificers.\" Both positions typically had two incumbents simultaneously and were held by men of high rank."}
{"context": "For the elevation see Fig. 33. a tomb was a massive rectangular oblong of masonry, the sides of which slanted inward at an angle of roughly seventy five degrees. It was, with the exception of its room or rooms, solid throughout, reminding the modern natives of the ‘‘mastaba,’’ the terrace, area or bench on which they squat before their houses and shops. Such a tomb is there- fore commonly termed a ‘‘mastaba.’’ The simplest of such mastabas has no rooms within, and only a false door in the east side, by which the dead, dwelling in the west, that is, behind this door, might enter again the world of the living. EARLY RELIGION 69 This false door was finally elaborated into a kind of chapel- chamber in the mass of the masonry, the false door now being placed in the west wall of the chamber. The inner walls of this chapel bore scenes carved in relief, depicting the servants and slaves of the deceased at their daily tasks on his estate (Figs. 44, 56); they plowed and sowed and reaped; they pastured the herds and slaughtered them for the table, they wrought stone vessels or they built Nile boats —in fact they were shown in field and workshop producing | all those things which were necessary for their lord’s welfare in the hereafter, while here and there his towering figure appeared superintending and inspecting their labours as he had done before he ‘‘departed into the West.’’ It is these scenes which are the source of our knowledge of the life and customs of the time. Far below the massive mastaba was a burial chamber in the native rock reached by a shaft which passed down through the superstructure of masonry. On the day of burial the body, now duly embalmed, was subjected to elaborate ceremonies embodying occurrences in the history of Osiris. It was especially necessary bypotent charms to open the mouth and ears of the deceased that he might speak and hear in the hereafter.. The mummy was then lowered down the shaft and laid as of old upon its left side in a fine rec- tangular cedar coffin, which again was deposited in a massive sarcophagus of granite or limestone. Food and drink were left with it, besides some few toilet articles, a magic wand and a number of amulets for protection against the enemies of the dead, especially serpents. The number of serpent- charms in the Pyramid Texts, intended to render these foes harmless, is very large.", "question": "What historical insights into daily life and customs are provided by the relief scenes found in mastaba chapels?", "answer": "The inner walls of the mastaba chapel bore relief scenes depicting the deceased's servants and slaves engaged in daily tasks on his estate, such as plowing, sowing, reaping, herding, slaughtering, making stone vessels, and building Nile boats. These scenes are a key historical source for understanding the life and customs of the period."}
{"context": "Hiera- conpolis was especially favoured, and an old feast in his honour, called the ‘‘ Worship of Horus,’’ celebrated every two years, is regularly recorded in the royal annals (Fig. 29).? The kings therefore continued without interruption the tra- ditions of the ‘‘ Worshippers of Horus,’’ as the successors of whom they regarded themselves. As long as the royal suc- cession continued in the Thinite family the worship of Horus was carefully observed; but with the ascendancy of the Third Dynasty, a Memphite family, it gradually gave way and was neglected. The priestly office was maintained of course as in the Old Kingdom by laymen, who were divided, as later, into four orders or phyles.

EARLIEST EGYPT AT opment, we can identify only two with certainty: Miebis and Usephais; but we have contemporary monuments from twelve of the eighteen kings who ruled during this period. The first difficulty which confronted them was the reconcilia- tion of the Northern Kingdom and its complete fusion with the larger nation. We have seen how, in administration, the two kingdoms remained distinct, and hinted that the union was a merely personal bond. The kings on ascending the throne celebrated a feast called ‘‘ Union of the T'wo Lands,’’! by which the first year of each king’s reign was character- ized and named. This union, thus shown to be so fresh in their minds, could not at first be made effectual. The North rebelled again and again. King Narmer, who probably lived near the beginning of the dynastic age, was obliged to punish the rebellious Libyan nomes in the western Delta. He took captives to the number of ‘‘one hundred and twenty thousand,’’ which deed must have involved the deportation of a whole district, whence he also plundered no less than ‘fone million four hundred and twenty thousand small, and four hundred thousand large cattle.’’ In the temple at Hiera- conpolis he left a magnificent slate palette (Fig. 19) accom- panied by a ceremonial mace-head, both of which bear scenes commemorating his victory.", "question": "How did the historical worship of Horus change with the transition from the Thinite family to the Third Dynasty?", "answer": "The worship of Horus was carefully observed as long as the royal succession continued in the Thinite family, but with the ascendancy of the Third Dynasty (a Memphite family), it gradually gave way and was neglected."}
{"context": "The symbol of his presence in the temple at Heliopolis was an obelisk, while at EKdfu, on the upper river, which was also an old centre of his worship, he appeared as a hawk, under the name Horus. The Moon as the measurer of time furnished the god of reckoning, of letters, and of wisdom, whose chief centre was at Shmin, or Hermopolis, as the Greeks who identified him with Hermes, called the place. He was identified with the ibis. The Sky, whom we have seen as Nut, was worshipped throughout the land, although Nut herself continued to play only a mythological role. The sky-goddess became the type of woman and of woman’s love and joy. At the ancient shrine of Dendereh she was the cow-goddess, Hathor; at Sais she was the joyous Neit; at Bubastis, in the form of a cat, she appeared as Bast; while at Memphis her genial aspects disappeared and she became a lionness, the goddess of storm and terror. The myth of Osiris, so human in its incidents and all its characteristics, rapidly induced the wide propa- gation of his worship, and although Isis still remained chiefly a figure in the myth, she became the type of wife and mother, upon which the people loved to dwell. Horus also, although he really belonged originally to the sun-myth and had nothing to do with Osiris, was for the people the embodi- ment of the qualities of a good son, and in him they constantly 60 A HISTORY OF EGYPT saw the ultimate triumph of the just cause. The immense influence of the Osiris-worship on the life of Egypt we shall have occasion to notice further in discussing mortuary beliefs. The original home of Osiris was at Dedu, called by the Greeks Busiris, in the Delta; but Abydos, in Upper Egypt, early gained a reputation of peculiar sanctity, because the head of Osiris was buried there. He always appeared as a closely swathed figure, enthroned as a Pharaoh or merely a curious pillar, a fetish surviving from his prehistoric worship. Into the circle of nature-divinities it is impossible to bring Ptah of Memphis, who was one of the early and great gods of Egypt. He was the patron of the artisan, the artificer and artist, and his High Priest was always the chief artist of the court. Such were the chief gods of Egypt, although many another important deity pre- sided in this or that temple, whom it would be impossible for us to notice here, even with a word. The external manifestations and the symbols with which the", "question": "How did the historical representation and characteristics of the Sky-goddess vary across different ancient Egyptian locations?", "answer": "The Sky-goddess, known as Nut mythologically, took various historical forms and characteristics: Hathor (cow-goddess) at Dendereh, Neit (joyous) at Sais, Bast (cat form) at Bubastis, and a lioness (goddess of storm and terror) at Memphis."}
{"context": "So powerful were the charms now uttered by Isis over the body of her dead husband that it was reanimated, and regained the use of its limbs; and although it was impos. sible for the departed god to resume his earthly life, he passed down in triumph as a living king, to become lord of the nether world. Isis later gave birth to a son, Horus, whom she secretly reared among the marshy fastnesses of the Delta as the avenger of his father. Grown to manhood, the youth pursued Set and in the ensuing awful battle, which raged from end to end of the land, both were fear- fully mutilated. But Set was defeated, and Horus tri- umphantly assumed the earthly throne of his father. There- upon Set entered the tribunal of the gods, and charged that the birth of Horus was not without stain, and that his claim to the throne was not valid. Defended by Thoth, the god of letters, Horus was vindicated and declared ‘‘true in speech,’’ or ‘‘triumphant.’’ According to another version it was Osiris himself who was thus vindicated. Not all the gods who appear in these tales and fancies became more than mythological figures. Many of them con- tinued merely in this role, without temple or form of wor- ship; they had but a folk-lore or finally a theological exist- ence. Others became the great gods of Egypt. In a land where a clear sky prevailed and rain was rarely seen, the | : EARLY RELIGION 59 incessant splendour of the sun was an insistent fact, which gave him the highest place in the thought and daily life of the people. Huis worship was almost universal, but the chief centre of his cult was at On, the Delta city, which the Greeks ealled Heliopolis. Here he was known as Re, which was the solar orb itself; or as Atum, the name of the decrepit sun, as an old man tottering down the west; again his name Khepri, written with a beetle in hieroglyphic, designated him in the youthful vigour of his rising. He had two barques with which he sailed across the heavens, one for the morning and the other for the afternoon, and when in this barque he entered the nether world to return to the east he brought light and joy to its disembodied denizens. The symbol of his presence in the temple at Heliopolis was an obelisk, while at EKdfu, on the upper river, which was also an old centre of his worship, he appeared as a hawk, under the name Horus.

{"context": "Prosperity, Health,’’ which properly followed only the name of the king or a royal prince, were sometimes added to that of the vizier. Such was the organization of this remarkable state, as we are able to discern it during the first two or three cen- turies of the Old Kingdom. In the thirtieth century before Christ it had reached an elaborate development of state functions under local officials, such as was not found in Kurope until far down in the history of the Roman Empire. It was, to sum up briefly, a closely centralized body of local officials, each a centre for all the organs of the local government, which in each nome were thus focussed in the local governor before converging upon the palace. A Pharaoh of power, force and ability, and loyal governors in the nomes, meant a strong state; but let the Pharaoh betray signs of weakness and the governors might gain an inde- pendence which would threaten the dissolution of the whole. It was the maintenance of the nomes each as a separate unit of government, and the interposition of the governor at its head between the Pharaoh and the nome, which rendered the system dangerous. These little states within the state, each frequently having its own governor, might too easily 84 A HISTORY OF EGYPT become independent centres of political power. How this process actually took place we shall be able to observe as we follow the career of the Old Kingdom in the next chapter. Such a process was rendered the more easy because the government did not maintain any uniform or compact mili- tary organization. Hach nome possessed its militia, com- manded by the civil officials, who were not necessarily trained soldiers; there was thus no class of exclusively mili- tary officers. The temple estates likewise maintained a body of such troops. They were for the most part employed in mining and quarrying expeditions, supplying the hosts nec- essary for the transportation of the enormous blocks often demanded by the architects. In such work they were under the command of the ‘‘treasurer of the God.’’ In case of serious war, as there was no standing army, this militia from all the nomes and temple estates, besides auxiliaries levied among the Nubian tribes, were brought together as quickly as possible and the command of the motley host, without any permanent organization, was entrusted by the monarch to some able official.

Here was focussed the entire system of government, which ramified throughout the country. For purposes of local government, Upper Egypt was divided into some twenty administrative districts, and later we find as many more in the Delta. These ‘‘nomes’’ were _ presumably the early principalities, from which the local princes who ruled them in prehistoric days, had long dis- appeared. At the head of such a district or nome there was in the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties an official appointed by the crown, and known as ‘‘First under the King.’’ Besides his administrative function as ‘‘local governor’’ of the nome, he also served in a judicial capacity, and therefore bore also the title of ‘‘judge.’’ In Upper Egypt these ‘‘local gov- ernors’’ were also sometimes styled ‘‘magnates of the 80 A HISTORY OF EGYPT Southern Ten,’’ as if there were a group among them enjoy- ing higher rank and forming a college or council of ten. While we are not so well informed regarding the government of the North, the system there was evidently very similar, although there were perhaps fewer local governors. Within the nome which he administered the ‘‘local governor’’ had under his control a miniature state, an administrative unit with all the organs of government: a treasury, a court of justice, a land-office, a service for the conservation of the dykes and canals, a body of militia, a magazine for their equipment ; and in these offices a host of scribes and record- ers, with an ever growing mass of archives and local records. The chief administrative bond which coordinated and cen- tralized these nomes was the organization of the treasury, by the operation of which there annually converged upon the magazines of the centrai government the grain, cattle, poul- try and industrial products, which in an age without coinage, were collected as taxes by the local governors.

The income of a mortuary priest in such a tomb was in one instance sufficient to enable him to endow the tomb of his daughter in the same way.® Such endowments and the service thus maintained were intended to be permanent, but in the course of a few generations the accumulated burden was intol- erable, and ancestors of a century before, with rare excep- tions, were necessarily neglected in order to maintain those whose claims were stronger and more recent.

But in later times, when the mortuary practices of the noble class had spread to the masses, they also employed the same prayer, although it is impossible that the royal bounty could have been so extended. Thus this prayer is to-day the most fre- quent formula to be found on the Egyptian monuments, occurring thousands of times on the tombs or tomb-stones of people who had no prospect of enjoying such royal dis- tinction; and in the same tomb it is always repeated over and over again.

Yet there is no doubt that side by side with these wholesome ideals of the wise and virtuous, there also existed wide-spread and gross immorality. The outward conditions of the lower class were not such as would incline toward moral living. In the towns their low mud-brick, thatch-roofed houses were crowded into groups and masses, so huddled together that the walls were often contiguous. A rough stool, a rude box or two, and a few crude pottery jars constituted ihe furniture of such a hovel. The barracks of the workmen were an immense succession of small mud-brick chambers under one roof, with open pas- sages between long lines of such rooms. Whole quarters for the royal levies of workmen were erected on this plan, in the pyramid-towns, and near the pyramids. On the great estates, the life of the poor was freer, less congested and promiscuous, and undoubtedly more stable and wholesome. 1 Pap. de Boulaq I, 16, 13 ff.; Erman, Aegypten, 223.

CHAPTER V THE OLD KINGDOM: GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY, INDUSTRY AND ART THE origins of the kingship and of the customs which made it so peculiar in ancient Egypt, as the reader has already observed, are rooted in a past so remote that we can discern but faint traces of the evolution of the office. With the consolidation under Menes it was already an institu- tion of great age, and over four centuriesof development which then followed, had at the dawn of the Old Kingdom already brought to the office a prestige and an exalted power, demanding the deepest reverence of the subject whether high or low. Indeed the king was now officially a god, and one of the most frequent titles was the ‘‘Good God’’; such was the respect due him that there was reluc- tance to refer to him by name. The courtier might desig- nate him impersonally as ‘‘one,’’ and ‘‘to let one know”’ becomes the official phrase for ‘‘report to the king.’’ His government and ultimately the monarch personally were called the ‘‘Great", "question": "What was the historical nature of kingship at the dawn of the Old Kingdom, and how was the Pharaoh perceived and referred to?", "answer": "At the dawn of the Old Kingdom, kingship was an institution of great age, wielding exalted power and prestige.

Even the palace of the king, though of course fortified, was of this light construction; hence the cities of ancient Egypt have disappeared entirely or left but mounds containing a few scanty fragments of ruined walls. Beds, chairs, stools and chests of ebony, inlaid with ivory in the finest workman- ship, formed the chief articles of furniture. Little or no use was made of tables, but the rich vessels of alabaster, and other costly stones, of copper, or sometimes of gold and silver, were placed upon bases and standards which raised them from the floor. The floors were covered with heavy rugs, upon which guests, especially ladies, frequently sat, in preference to the chairs and stools.

The costume of these ancient lords was simple in the extreme; it consisted merely of a white linen kilt, secured above the hips with a girdle or band, and hanging often hardly to the knees, or again in another style, to the calf of the leg. The head was commonly shaven, and two styles of wig, one short and curly, the other with long straight locks parted in the middle, were worn on all state occasions. A broad collar, often inlaid with costly stones, generally hung from the neck, but otherwise the body was bare from the waist up.

His lady and her daughters all appeared in costumes even more simple. They were clothed in a thin, close-fitting, sleeveless, white linen gar- ment hanging from the breast to the ankles, and supported by two bands passing over the shoulders. The skirt, as a modern modiste would say ‘‘ lacked fullness,’’ and there was barely freedom to walk. A long wig, a collar and necklace, and a pair of bracelets completed the lady’s costume. Neither she nor her lord was fond of sandals; although they now and then wore them.", "question": "What were the historical characteristics of the houses and furnishings of the wealthy class in ancient Egypt?", "answer": "The houses of the rich were large, commodious, and built of wood and sun-dried brick, featuring light and airy construction with many latticed windows.

{"context": "While a certain freedom of development sur- vived, that style in its fundamentals persisted throughout the history of Egyptian art, even after the artist had learned to perceive its shortcomings. The age which produced it had not learned to maintain one point of view in the drawing of any given scene or object; two different points of view were combined in the same figure: in drawing a man a front view of the eyes and shoulders was regularly placed upon a profile of the trunk and legs. This unconscious incongruity was afterward also extended to temporal relations, and suc- cessive instants of time were combined in the same scene. Accepting these limitations, the reliefs of the Old Kingdom, which are really slightly modelled drawings, are often sculp- tures of rare beauty (Fig. 56). It is from the scenes which the Memphite sculptor placed on the walls of the mastaba- chapels that we learn all that we know of the life and cus- toms of the Old Kingdom. The exquisite modelling, of which such a sculptor was capable, is perhaps best exhib- ited in the wooden doors of Hesire (Fig. 59). All such reliefs were coloured, so that when completed, we may call them raised and modelled paintings; at least they do not 106 A HISTORY OF EGYPT fall within the domain of plastic art, as do Greek reliefs. Painting was also practiced independently, and the familiar line of geese from a tomb at Medum (Fig.55) well illustrates the strength and freedom with which the Memphite of the time could depict the animal forms with which he was famil- iar. The characteristic poise of the head, the slow walk, the sudden droop of the neck as the head falls to seize the worm, all these are the work of a strong and confident draughtsman, long schooled in his art. The sculpture of the Old Kingdom may be characterized as a natural and unconscious realism, exercised with a tech- nical ability of the highest order. In the practice of this art, the sculptor of the Old Kingdom compares favourably even with modern artists. He was the only artist in the early orient who could put the human body into stone, and living in a society such that he was daily familiarized with the nude form, he treated it with sincerity and frankness.

The priestly scribes of the Fifth Dynasty compiled the annals of the oldest kings, from the bare names of the kings, who ruled the two prehistoric king- doms, to the Fifth Dynasty itself; but it was a bald catalogue of events, achievements and temple donations, without lit- erary form. It is the oldest surviving fragment of royal annals. As the desire to perpetuate the story of a dis- tinguished life increased, the nobles began to record in their tombs simple narratives characterized by a primitive direct- ness, in long successions of simple sentences, each showing the same construction, but lacking expressed connectives.' Events and honours common to the lives of the leading nobles were related by them all in the identical words, so that con- ventional phrases had already gained place in literature not unlike the inviolable canons of their graphic art. There is no individuality. The mortuary texts in the pyramids display sometimes a rude force, and an almost savage fire. They contain scattered fragments of the old myths but whether these had then enjoyed more than an oral existence we do not know. Mutilated religious poems, exhibiting in form the beginnings of parallelism, are imbedded in this literature, and are doubtless examples of the oldest poetry of earliest Egypt. All this literature, both in form and content, betrays its origin among men of the early world. Folk songs, the offspring of the toiling peasant’s flitting fancy, or of the per- sonal devotion of the household servant, were common then as now, and in two of them which have survived, we hear the shepherd talking with the sheep,” or the bearers of the sedan-chair assuring their lord in song that the vehicle is lighter to them when he occupies it, than when it is empty.® Music also was cultivated; and there was a director of the royal music at the court.

The attempt to write these figures rap- idly with ink upon papyrus had gradually resulted in reduc- ing each sign to a mere outline, much rounded off and abbre- viated.

The introduction of this system into the administration of government and the transaction of every day business, produced profound changes in gov- ernment and society, and created for all time the class dis- tinction between the illiterate and the learned, which is still a problem of modern society. It was the acquirement of this method of writing which enabled the lad to enter upon the coveted official career as a scribe or overseer of a maga- zine, or steward of an estate. Hence the master put before the boy model-letters, proverbs, and literary compositions, which he labouriously copied into his roll, the copy-book of this ancient school-boy.

Education thus consisted solely of the practically useful equipment for an official career. Knowledge of nature and of the external world as a whole was sought only as necessity prompted such search. As we have already intimated, it never occurred to the Egyptian to enter upon the search for truth for its own sake.

C., the Thinites were finally dislodged from the position of power which they had maintained so well for over four centuries, according to Manetho, and a Memphite family, whose home was the ‘‘ White Wall’’ gained the ascendancy. But there is evidence that the sharp dynas- tic division recorded by Manetho never took place, and this final supremacy of Memphis may have been nothing more than a gradual transition thither by the Thinites themselves. In any case the great queen, Nemathap, the wife of King Khasekhemui, who was probably the last king of the Second Dynasty, was evidently the mother of Zoser, with whose accession the predominance of Memphis becomes apparent. During this Memphite supremacy, the development which the Thinites had pushed so vigourously, was skilfully and ably fostered. For over five hundred years the kingdom continued to flourish, but of these five centuries only the last two have left us even scanty literary remains, and we are obliged to draw our meagre knowledge of its first three cen- turies almost entirely from material documents, the monu- ments which it has left us.

In some degree such a task is like attempting to reconstruct a history of Athens in the age of Pericles, based entirely upon the temples, sculptures, vases, and other material remains surviving from his time. While the rich intellectual, literary, and political life which was then unfolding in Athens involved a mental endowment and a condition of state and society which Egypt, even at her best, never knew, yet it must not be forgotten that, tremen- dous as is the impression which we receive from the monu- 111 112 A HISTORY OF EGYPT ments of the Old Kingdom, they are but the skeleton, upon which we might put flesh, and endue the whole with life, if but the chief literary monuments of the time had survived. It is a difficult task to see behind these Titanic achievements, the busy world of commerce, industry, administration, so- ciety, art, and literature out of which they grew. Of half a millennium of political change, of overthrow and usurpation, of growth and decay of institutions, of local governors, help- less under the strong grasp of the Pharaoh, or shaking off the restraint of a weak monarch, and developing into inde- pendent barons, so powerful at last as to bring in the final dissolution of the state ;—of all this we gain but fleeting and occasional glimpses, where more must be guessed than can be known. The first prominent figure in the Old Kingdom is that of Zoser, with whom as we have said the Third Dynasty arose. It was evidently his forceful government which firmly estab- lished Memphite supremacy. He continued the exploitation of the copper mines in Sinai, while in the south he extended the frontier. If we may credit a late tradition of the priests, the turbulent tribes of northern Nubia, who for centuries after Zoser’s reign continued to make the region of the first cataract unsafe, were so controlled by him that he could grant to Khnum, the god of the cataract at least nominal posses- sion of both sides of the river from Elephantine at the lower end of the cataract up to Takompso, some seventy five or eighty miles above it.", "question": "What historical limitations do scholars face when trying to understand the political and social life of the Old Kingdom, beyond its material achievements?", "answer": "Despite the impressive monuments, the lack of chief literary monuments means historians can only gain fleeting and occasional glimpses of the rich intellectual, literary, and political life, leaving much to be guessed about political changes, overthrow, and the growth and decay of institutions."}
{"context": "Knowledge of nature and of the external world as a whole was sought only as necessity prompted such search. As we have already intimated, it never occurred to the Egyptian to enter upon the search for truth for its own sake. Under these circumstances, the science of the time, if we may speak of it as such at all, was such a knowledge of natural conditions as enabled the active men of this age to accomplish those practical tasks with which they were daily confronted. They had much practical ac- quaintance with astronomy, developed out of that knowl- edge which had enabled their ancestors to introduce a rational calendar nearly thirteen centuries before the rise of the Old Kingdom. They had already mapped the heavens, identified the more prominent fixed stars, and developed a system of observation with instruments sufficiently accurate to determine the positions of stars for practical purposes; but they had produced no theory of the heavenly bodies as a whole, nor would it ever have occurred to the Egyptian that such an attempt was useful or worth the trouble. In mathematics all the ordinary arithmetical processes were demanded in the daily transactions of business and govern- ment, and had long since come into common use among the scribes. Fractions, however, caused difficulty. The scribes could operate only with those having one as the numerator, and all other fractions were of necessity resolved into a series of several, each with one as the numerator. The only exception was two thirds, which they had learned to use without so resolving it. Klementary algebraic problems were also solved without difficulty. In geometry they were able to master the simpler problems, though the area of a trape- (‘wnasny o1red) (‘wnasny o11e9) ‘Suvjsiey Aq punojs Jepeyy ig ie quoy ve woig UMAAO JO ANLVLIS ANO 4 ‘NHYH AO ANLVIS ALIMO 8F 514 “HOUV ALSVNA GYIHL LF 14 THE OLD KINGDOM 101 zoid caused some difficulties and errors, while the area of the circle had been determined with close accuracy.

The architect em- ployed only straight lines, these being perpendiculars and horizontals, veryboldly and felicitously combined. The arch, although known, was not employed as a member in archi- tecture. In order to carry the roof across the void, either the simplest of stone piers, a square pillar of a single block of granite was employed, or an already elaborate and beau- tiful monolithic column of granite supported the architrave. These columns, the earliest known in the history of archi- tecture, must have been employed before the Old Kingdom, for they are fully developed in the Fifth Dynasty. They represent a palm-tree (Fig. 60), the capital being the crown of foliage; or they are conceived as a bundle of papyrus stalks, bearing the architrave upon the cluster of buds at the top, which form the capital (Figs. 60, 61). The proportions are faultless, and surrounded with such exquisite colonnades as these, flanked by brightly coloured reliefs, the courts of the Old Kingdom temples belong to the noblest architectural conceptions bequeathed to us by antiquity. Egypt thus became the source of columned architecture. While the Babylonian builders displayed notable skill in giving varied architectural effect to great masses, they were limited to this, and the colonnade was unknown to them; whereas the Egyptian already at the close of the fourth millennium before Christ had solved the fundamental problem of great architec- ture, developing with the most refined artistic sense and the greatest mechanical skill the treatment of voids, and thus originating the colonnade. The age was dealing with material things and developing material resources, and in such an age literature has little opportunity; it was indeed hardly born as yet. The sages of the court, the wise old viziers, Kegemne, Imhotep, and Ptahhotep, had put into proverbs the wholesome wisdom of life, which a long career had taught them, and these were probably already circulating in written form, although the | LZ tify Fic. 61.

{"context": "The necessity of determining the content of a pile of grain had led to a roughly approximate result in the computation of the content of the hemisphere, and a circular granary to that of the cylinder. But no theoretical problems were dis- cussed, and the whole science attempted only those problems which were continually met in daily life. The laying out of a ground-plan like the square base of the Great Pyramid could be accomplished with amazing accuracy, and the orientation displays a nicety that almost rivals the results of modern instruments. A highly developed knowledge of me- chanics was thus at the command of the architect and crafts- man. The arch was employed in masonry and can be dated as far back as the thirtieth century B. C., the oldest dated arches known (Fig. 47). In the application of power to the movement of great monuments, only the simplest devices were employed; the pulley was unknown and probably the roller also. Medicine was already in possession of much empirical wisdom, displaying close and accurate observa- tion; the calling of the physician already existed and the court physician of the Pharaoh was a man of rank and in- fluence. His recipes were many of them rational and useful; others were naively fanciful, like the prescription of a decoc- tion of the hair of a black calf to prevent gray hair. They had already been collected and recorded in papyrus rolls,! and the recipes of this age were famous for their virtue in later times. Some of them finally crossed with the Greeks to Europe, where they are still in use among the peasantry of the present day. That which precluded any progress toward real science was the belief in magic, which later began to dominate all the practice of the physician. There was no great distinction between the physician and the magician. All remedies were administered with more or less reliance upon magical charms; and in many cases the magical ‘‘hocus pocus’’ of the physician was thought to be 17, 246, 102 A HISTORY OF EGYPT of itself more effective than any remedy that could be admin- istered. Disease was due to hostile spirits, and against these only magic could avail. Art flourished as nowhere else in the ancient world. Here again the Egyptian’s attitude of mind was not wholly that which characterized the art of the later Greek world. Art as the pursuit and the production exclusively of the ideally beautiful, was unknown to him.", "question": "What was the historical nature of scientific inquiry in ancient Egypt, particularly in astronomy?", "answer": "Ancient Egyptian science was primarily practical, focused on daily tasks, and did not pursue truth for its own sake. Their astronomy involved mapping the heavens and identifying fixed stars for practical purposes, but they did not develop comprehensive theories about celestial bodies."}
{"context": "That the new dynasty was obliged to consider the nobles who had assisted in its rise to power, is also to be discerned in the appointment by Userkaf, the first of the line, of his palace steward to the governorship of a district in middle Egypt called the ‘‘New Towns,’” to which office he added the income of two priesthoods in the vicinity, which had been * Borchardt, Festschr. f.

But the endowment estab- lished by the Fourth Dynasty was respected. While Userkaf, as the founder of the new dynasty, may have had enough to do to make secure the succession of his line, he has left his name’ on the rocks at the first cataract, the earliest of the long series of rock-inscriptions there, which from now on will furnish us many hints of the career of the Pharaohs in the south. Sahure, who followed Userkaf, con- tinued the development of Egypt as the earliest known naval power in history. ‘de dispatched a fleet against the Phceni- cian coast, and a relief just discovered in his pyramid temple at Abusir, shows four of the ships with Phenician captives among the Egyptian sailors. This is the earliest surviving representation of sea-going ships (c. 2750 B. C.), and the oldest known picture of Semitic Syrians. Another fleet was sent by Sahure to still remoter waters, on a voy- age to Punt, as the Egyptian called the Somali coast at the south end of the Red Sea, and along the south side of the gulf of Aden. From this region, which like the whole east, he termed the ‘‘God’s-Land,’’ he obtained the fragrant gums and resins so much desired for the incense and ointments indispensable in the life of the oriental. Voyages to this country may have been made as early as the First Dynasty, for at that time the Pharaohs already used myrrh in considerable quantities, although this may have been obtained in trade with the intermediate tribes who brought it overland, down the Blue Nile, the Atbara and the Upper Nile. In the Fourth Dynasty a son of Khufu had possessed a Puntite slave,? but Sahure was the first Pharaoh whose records? show direct communication with the coun- try of Punt for this purpose. His expedition brought back 80,000 measures of myrrh, probably 6,000 weight of elec- trum (gold-silver alloy), besides 2,600 staves of some costly wood, presumably ebony.

{"context": "This splendid entrance stands beside the Great Sphinx, and is still usually termed the ‘‘temple of the sphinx,’’ with which it had, how- ever, nothing to do. Whether the sphinx itself is the work of Khafre is not yet determined. In Egypt the sphinx is an oft recurring portrait of the king, the lion’s body sym- bolizing the Pharaoh’s power. The Great Sphinx is there- fore the portrait of a Pharaoh, and an obscure reference to Khafre in an inscription between its forepaws dated fourteen hundred years later in the reign of Thutmose IV,? perhaps shows that in those times he was considered to have had something to do with it. Beyond these buildings we know nothing of Khafre’s deeds, but these show clearly that the great state which Khufu had done so much to create was still firmly controlled by the Pharaoh. 1 Fig. 48 and p. 103. 27, 815. THE PYRAMID BUILDERS 121 Under Khafre’s successor, Menkure, however, if the size of the royal pyramid is an adequate basis for judgment, the power of the royal house was no longer so absolute. Moreover, the vast pyramids which his two predecessors had erected may have so depleted the resources of the state that Menkure was not able to extort more from an exhausted nation. The third pyramid of Gizeh which we owe to him, is less than half as high as those of Khufu and Khafre; its ruined temple recently excavated by Reisner, unfinished at his death, was faced with sun-dried brick, instead of sumptuous granite, by his successor. Of his immediate successors, we possess contemporary monuments only from the reign of Shepse- skaf. Although we have a record that he selected the site for his pyramid in his first year,! he was unable to erect a monument sufficiently large and durable to survive, and we do not even know where it was located; while of the achieve- ments of this whole group of kings at the close of the Fourth Dynasty, including several interlopers, who may now have assumed the throne for a brief time, we know nothing whatever. The century and a half during which the Fourth Dynasty maintained its power was a period of unprecedented splen- dour in the history of the Nile valley people, and as we have seen, the monuments of the time were on a scale of grandeur which was never later eclipsed. It reached its climacteric point in Khufu, and after probably a slight decline in the reign of Khafre, Menkure was no longer able to command the closely centralized power which the family had so success- fully maintained up to that time.", "question": "What did the characteristics of Menkure's pyramid indicate about the power of the royal house or state resources?", "answer": "The smaller size of Menkure's pyramid and its use of sun-dried brick for its temple (instead of granite) suggest that the power of the royal house was no longer as absolute, or that state resources were depleted."}

Under Isesi, however, the self consciousness of the official can no longer be completely repressed, and for the first time we find under the usual triumphant relief a single line! stating that the expedition was carried out under the command of a certain officer. It is but a hint of the rising power of the officials, who from now on never fail to make themselves increasingly prominent in all records of the royal achievements. It is a power with which the Pharaoh will find more and more diffi- culty in dealing as time passes. There is perhaps another evidence that the Fifth Dynasty kings no longer possessed the unlimited power enjoyed by their predecessors of the Fourth Dynasty. Their limestone pyramids ranged along the desert margin south of Gizeh, at Abusir and Sakkara, are small,—less than half as high as the great pyramid, and the core is of such poor construction, being largely loose blocks, or even rubble and sand, that they are now in com- plete ruin, each pyramid being a low mound with little sem- blance of the pyramid form.

{"context": "We only see him looming grandly from the obscure array of Pharaohs of his time, his greatness pro- claimed by the noble tomb which he erected at Gizeh, oppo- site modern Cairo. It has now become the chief project of the state to furnish a vast, impenetrable and indestructible resting place for the body of the king, who concentrated upon this enterprise the greatest resources of wealth, skill and labour at his command. How strong and effective must have been the organization of Khufu’s government we appreciate in some measure when we learn that his pyramid contains some two million three hundred thousand blocks, each weigh- ing on the average two and a half tons.1_ The mere organiza- tion of labour involved in the quarrying, transportation and proper assembly of this vast mass of material is a task which in itself must have severely taxed the public offices. Herod- otus relates a tradition current in his time that the pyramid had demanded the labour of a hundred thousand men during twenty years, and Petrie has shown that these numbers are quite credible. The maintenance of this city of a hundred ' thousand labourers, who were non-producing and a constant burden on the state, the adjustment of the labour in the quar- ries so as to ensure an uninterrupted accession of material around the base of the pyramid, will have entailed the devel- opment of a small state in itself. The blocks were taken out of the quarries on the east side of the river south of Cairo, and at high water, when the flats were flooded, they were floated across the valley to the base of the pyramid hill. Here an enormous stone ramp or causeway had been erected, a labour of ten years if we may believe Herodotus, and up this incline the stones were dragged to the plateau on which the pyramid stands. Not merely was this work quantitatively so formidable but in quality also it is the most remarkable material enterprise known to us in this early world, for the most ponderous masonry in the pyramid amazes the modern beholder by its fineness. It was but five centuries since the 1 Petrie, Gizeh. i118 A HISTORY OF EGYPT crude granite floor of the tomb of Usephais at Abydos was laid, and perhaps not more than a century since the earliest stone structure now known, the limestone chamber in the tomb of Khasekhemui at the same place was erected.", "question": "How were the massive stone blocks transported from the quarries to the pyramid site at Gizeh?", "answer": "The blocks were taken from quarries on the east side of the river south of Cairo, floated across the valley at high water, and then dragged up an enormous stone ramp or causeway to the pyramid plateau."}

The remains of the causeway leading up from the plain to the temple still rise in sombre ruin, disclosing only the rough core masonry, across which the modern village of Kafr is now built. Further south is a section of the wall which surrounded the town on the plain below, probably the place of Khufu’s resi- dence, and perhaps the residence of the dynasty. In leaving the tomb of Khufu our admiration for the monument, whether stirred by its vast dimensions or by the fineness of its masonry should not obscure its real and final significance; for the great pyramid is the earliest and most impressive witness surviving from the ancient world to the final emer- gence of organized society from prehistoric chaos and local conflict, thus coming for the first time completely under the power of a far-reaching and comprehensive centraliza- tion effected by one controlling mind. Khufu’s name has been found from Desuk in the north- western and Bubastis in the eastern Delta, to Hieraconpolis in the south, but we know almost nothing of his other achievements. He continued operations in the peninsula of Sinai; perhaps opened for the first time, and in any case kept workmen in the alabaster quarry of Hatnub; and Ptole- maic tradition also made him the builder of a Hathor temple at Dendera.? It will be evident that all the resources of the nation were completely at his disposal and under his control ; his eldest son, as was customary in the Fourth Dynasty, was vizier and chief judge; while the two ‘‘treasurers of the God,’’ who were in charge of the work in the quarries, were undoubtedly also sons of the king, as we have seen.", "question": "For whom were the three small pyramids located near Khufu's Great Pyramid built?", "answer": "Three small pyramids were built for members of Khufu's family and stand in a line close by on the east of his Great Pyramid."}

In the sun-myth he became king of Upper and Lower Egypt and, like a Pharaoh, he had ruled Egypt with Thoth as his vizier. The change in the royal line is also evident in the organi- zation of the government. The eldest son of the king is no longer the most powerful officer in the state, but the posi- tion which he held in the Fourth Dynasty as vizier and chief judge is now the prerogative of another family, with whom it remains hereditary. Each incumbent, through five gen- erations, bore the name Ptahhotep. It would almost seem as if the priests of Ptah and the priests of Heliopolis had made common cause, dividing the power between them, so that the high priest of Re became Pharaoh, and the followers of Ptah received the viziership. In any case the Pharaoh was now obliged to reckon with a family of his lords as successive viziers.

He had already been known as a judge in the Old Kingdom, but it was not until the Middle Kingdom that this idea was clearly developed and took firm hold upon the mortuary beliefs of the time. Before Osiris, enthroned with forty two assistant judges, hideous demons, each representing one of the nomes into which Egypt was divided, the deceased was led into the judgment-hall. Here he addressed his judges, and to each one of the forty two assistants he pleaded not guilty to a certain sin, while his heart was weighed in the balances over against a feather, the symbol of truth, in order to test the truth of his plea. The forty two sins, of which he says he was not guilty, are those which are con- demned as well by the modern conscience of the world. They may be summed up as murder, stealing, especially robbing minors, lying, deceit, false witness and slander, revil- ing, eaves-dropping, sexual impurity, adultery, and trespass against the gods or the dead as in blasphemy or stealing of mortuary offerings. It will be seen that the ethical standard was high; moreover in this judgment the Egyptian intro- duced for the first time in the history of man the fully developed idea that the future destiny of the dead must be dependent entirely upon the ethical quality of the earthly life, the idea of future accountability,—of which we found the first traces in the Old Kingdom. The whole concep- tion is notable; for a thousand years or more after this no such idea was known among other peoples, and in Babylonia and Israel good and bad alike descendedtogether at death into gloomy Sheol, where no distinction was made between them. Those who failed to sustain the ordeal before Osiris successfully were condemned to hunger and thirst, lying in the darkness of the tomb, from which they might not come: 174 A HISTORY OF EGYPT forth to view the sun.

The central office of the treasury was still the ‘‘ White House,’’ which through its sub-departments of the granary, the herds, the ‘‘double gold-house,’’ the ‘‘double silver- house,’’ and other produce of the country, collected into the central magazines and stock-yards the annual revenues due the Pharaoh. Whole fleets of transports! upon the river were necessary for the conveyance of the great quantities of commodities involved. The head of the ‘‘ White House”’ was as before, the chief treasurer, with his assistant, the ‘‘treasurer of the God,’’ and the vigourous administration of the time is evident in the frequent records of these active officials, showing that notwithstanding their rank, they often personally superintended the king’s interests in Sinai, Ham- mamat, or on the shores of the Red Sea at the terminus of the Coptos road. It is evident that the treasury had become a more highly developed organ since the Old Kingdom. The army of subordinates, stewards, overseers and scribes filling the offices under the heads of sub-departments was obviously larger than before. They began to display an array of titles, of which many successive ranks, heretofore unknown, were being gradually differentiated. Among these appear more prominently than heretofore the engineers and skilled artisans who were exploiting the mines and quarries under the administrative officials. Such conditions made possible the rise of an official middle class. Justice, as in the Old Kingdom, was still dispensed by the administrative officials; thus a treasurer of the god boasts that he was one ‘‘knowing the law, discreet in exercising it.’’\"2 The six ‘‘Great Houses’’ or courts of justice, with the vizier at their head, sat in Ithtowe.2?

A father bringing his son to be educated as a scribe at the court-school exhorts: him to industry, and taking up calling after calling, shows that every handicraft abounds in difficulties and hardships; while that of the scribe alone brings honour, ease and wealth.? Although the state of the arts shows clearly that the crafts- men of the time were often men of the finest ability, whose station in life could not have been undesirable, the scribal and official middle class thus looked down upon them, and exalted the calling of the scribe above all others. From this time on we shall find the scribe constantly glorying in his knowl- edge and his station. While the monuments of the Old Kingdom revealed to us only the life of the titled nobility at the court and the serfs on their estates, in the Middle Kingdom we thus discern a prosperous and often well-to-do middle class in the provinces, sometimes owning their own slaves and lands and bringing their offerings of first fruits to the temple of the town as did the nomarch himself?

I made a canal for my city and I ferried [people] over it in my boat. I was one ready [for service], leading my peasants until the coming of the day when it was well with me [day of death], when I gave it [his wealth] to my son by will.’ At the bottom of the social scale were the unnamed serfs, the ‘‘ peas- ants’’ of the inscription just read, the toiling millions who produced the agricultural wealth of the land,—the despised class whose labour nevertheless formed the basis of the eco- nomic life of the nation. In the nomes they were also taught handicrafts and we see them depicted in the tombs at Beni- hasan and elsewhere engaged in the production of all sorts of handiwork.", "question": "What notable difference emerged in the social structure and visibility of the middle class in the Middle Kingdom compared to the Old Kingdom?", "answer": "Unlike the Old Kingdom, where only the nobility and serfs were revealed, the Middle Kingdom saw the emergence of a prosperous and often well-to-do middle class in the provinces.

There were in this movement the beginnings of a tendency toward a pantheistic solar monotheism, which we shall yet trace to its remarkable culmination. While the temples had probably somewhat increased in size, the official cult was not materially altered, and there was still no large class of priests. Sesostris II’s temple of Anubis at Kahun by the Fayum had over it only a noble with the office of ‘‘overseer of the temple,’’ assisted by a ‘‘chief lector,’’ with nine subordinates. Only the ‘‘overseer of the temple’’’ and the ‘‘lector’’ were constantly in service at the sanctuary, the nine subordinates being laymen, who served the temple only one month in the year, giving place each month to a new nine, to whom they turned over the temple property each time. Besides these, the menial duties of the sanctuary demanded six door-keepers and two ser- vants.* The triumph of Osiris was not less sweeping than that of Re, although for totally different reasons. The supremacy of Re was largely due to his political prominence, added to the prestige which the sun-god had always enjoyed in the Nile valley; while that of Osiris had no connection with the state, but was a purely popular victory. That his priests contrib- uted to his triumph by persistent propaganda is nevertheless probable, but their field of operations will have been among the people. At Abydos the Osiris-myth was wrought into a series of dramatical presentations in which the chief inci- dents of the god’s life, death and final triumph were annually enacted before the people by the priests. Indeed in the pres- entation of some portions of it the people were permitted to participate; and the whole was unquestionably as impres- Sive in the eyes of the multitude as were the miracle and passion plays of the Christian age. We find upon their tomb-stones not uncommonly the prayer that in the future 1 Borchardt, Zeitschrift fiir AegyptischeSprache, 1900, 94. £1, 662, 669. 172 A HISTORY OF EGYPT they may be able to come forth from the tomb and view these festal presentations.

There were also frightful execu- tioners, one of which, a hideous combination of crocodile, lion and hippopotamus, was present at the judgment, and to her the guilty were delivered to be torn in pieces. In harmony with the triumph of the notion of judgment, it is noticeable in the Middle Kingdom that the desire to enjoy at least the reputation of a benevolent and blameless life was more general than before. We now more often read upon the tomb-stones such words as we noticed in the Old Kingdom, ‘‘I gave bread to the hungry, water to the thirsty, clothing to the naked and a ferry-boat to the boatless’’; or ‘‘T was father to the orphan, husband to the widow, and a shelter to the shelterless.’’ We have already referred to the benevolence of the feudal lords of the time. The blessed dead, who successfully sustained the judgment each received the predicate ‘‘true of speech,’’ a term which was interpreted as meaning ‘‘triumphant,’’ and from now on so employed. Every deceased person, when spoken of by the living, received this predicate; it was always written after the names of the dead, and finally also after those of the living in anticipation of their happy destiny. The pre- vailing notions regarding the future life had not been clari- fied by the universal sway of Osiris. On the contrary, all the old beliefs were now intermingled in inextricable con- fusion, only worse confounded by the effort to accommodate them to the Osiris faith, with which in the beginning they had had nothing to do. The favourite idea is still that the departed sojourn in the field of Yaru, enjoying peace and plenty, to which they contribute by cultivating the fruitful plains of the isle, which bring forth grain twelve feet high. At the same time they may dwell in the tomb or tarry in its vicinity; they may mount the heavens to be the comrades of Re; they may descend to the realm of Osiris in the nether world; or they may consort with the noble dead who once ruled Egypt at Abydos.

A new irrigation canal which he made doubtless contributed much to the productivity of his do- mains.‘ Faithful officials of the nomarch show the same solicitude for the welfare of the community over which they were placed; thus an assistant treasurer in the Theban nome residing at Gebelen in the Eleventh Dynasty tells us: ‘‘I sustained Gebelen during unfruitful years, there being four hundred men in distress. But I took not the daughter of a man, I took not his field. I made ten herds of goats, with people in charge of each herd; I made two herds of cattle and a herd of asses. I raised all kinds of small cattle. I made thirty ships, then thirty more ships, and I brought grain for Esneh and Tuphium, after Gebelen was sustained. The nome of Thebes went up stream [to Gebelen for sup- plies]. Never did Gebelen send up-stream or down-stream to another district [for supplies].’?> The nomarch thus devoted himself to the interests of his people, and was con- cerned to leave to posterity a reputation as a merciful and beneficent ruler. All the above records are taken from tomb- inscriptions, records designed to perpetuate such a memory among the people. Still more positive in the same direc- tion is a passage in the biography of Ameni, nomarch of the Oryx-nome, as inscribed in his tomb at Benihasan: ‘‘There 11, 637. 21, 638. 31, 408. ‘J, 407. 61, 459.

As we shall see, they had the census and tax records in charge; but their connection with the judicial administration cannot be determined with clearness. Magistrates with the sole title of ‘‘judge,’’ whose tomb-stones are occasionally found, may have been well-to-do middle class citizens who assumed judicial functions within a restricted local jurisdiction. The law which they administered, while it has not survived, had certainly attained a high development, and was capable of the finest distinctions. A nomarch at Siut makes a contract between himself as count, and himself as high priest in the temple of his city, showing the closest differentiation of the rights which he possessed in these two different capacities. The scanty records of the time throw but little light upon the other organs of government, like the administration of lands, the system of irrigation and the like. For the pur- pose of carrying on public works, as well as for taxation and census records, the country was divided into two adminis- trative districts of the South and the North, and the ‘‘ Mag- nates of the Southern Tens’’ served in both districts, showing that they were not confined to the South alone. The office of the governor of the South had disappeared, and already before the close of the Old Kingdom the title had become merely an honourable predicate, if used at all.

Every head of a family was enrolled as soon as he had established an indepen- dent household, with all the members belonging to it, includ- ing serfs and slaves.

It was still standing in Strabo’s time, when it had already long been known as the Labyrinth, one of the wonders of Egypt, famous among travellers and historians of the Greco-Roman world, who compared its intricate com- plex of halls and passages with the Cretan Labyrinth of Greek tradition. It is the only building of this remote age, not exclusively a temple, known to have survived so long; and Strabo’s description of its construction accounts for its durability, for he says: ‘‘It is a marvellous fact that each of the ceilings of the chambers consists of a single stone, and also that the passages are covered in the same way with single slabs of extraordinary size, neither wood nor other building material having been employed.’’ The town which had grown up around this remarkable building was seen by Strabo; but both have now completely disappeared.

Profiting by his ten years’ experience as coregent with his father, Sesostris I was able to maintain with undimmed splendour the pres- tige of his house. He proved himself quite capable of con- tinuing the great enterprises which he had inherited. The conquest of Nubia was pushed as before; the feudatories were called upon to muster their quotas, and Ameni, later nomarch of the Oryx-nome, relates in his Benihasan tomb that his father, who had been appointed nomarch by Ame- nemhet I, was now too old to undertake such a campaign, and that he himself, therefore, as his father’s representa- tive placed himself at the head of the troops of the Oryx- nome, and penetrated Kush under the leadership of his liege, Sesostris I. The war was thus carried above the second cat- aract into the great region known as Kush, which now becomes common in the monumental records, although the name occurs but once upon the monuments of the Old King- dom.” We know nothing of the course of the campaign, but it did not involve serious fighting, for Ameni boasts that he returned without the loss of a man.* The nomarch 41, 486 ff.

The campaign is notable as the first in a foreign country ever led by the Pharaoh personally, in so far as we know. The date of the expedition is unknown, but it was doubtless earlier than that which occurred eight years after the death of the king’s father, for Sesostris I then no longer regarded it as necessary to lead the conquest of the South in person. He therefore dispatched Mentu- hotep, one of his commanders, on a further campaign in Kush. Mentuhotep left a large stela? at Wadi Halfa, just below the second cataract, recording his triumph and giving us the first list of conquered foreign districts and towns which we possess. Unfortunately we know so little of Nubian geography in this distant age that only one of the ten districts enumerated can be located.

It is doubtless true that the circumstances in which these kings of the feudal period found themselves forced them to seek new sources of wealth outside of the country; but at the same time, as we have before intimated, they raised the productive capacity of the land to an unprecedented level. Unfortunately, the annals or records of these achievements have not survived. It was particularly Amenemhet III of whom we have evidence of attention to the irrigation system. His officials in the fortress of Semneh at the second cataract had instructions to record the height of the Nile on the rocks there, which thus in a few years became a nilometer, recording the maximum level of the high water from year to year. These records,’ still preserved upon the rocks, are from twenty five to thirty feet higher than the Nile rises at the present day. Such observations, communicated without delay to the officials of lower Egypt in the vizier’s office, enabled them to estimate the crops of the coming season, and the rate of taxation was fixed accordingly. In Lower Egypt a plan was also devised for extending the time during which the waters of the inundation could be made available by an enormous scheme of irrigation, which was carried out with brilliant success.

Be- sides the serpents common in the Pyramid Texts, the most uncanny foes await him. There is the crocodile, who may rob the deceased of all his potent charms, the foes of the air, who may withdraw breath from his nostrils; water may burst into flame as he would drink; he may be deprived of his mortuary food and drink, and be forced to devour the refuse of his own body; he may be robbed of his throne and place; his body may fall into decay; his foes may rob him of his mouth, his heart, or even of his head; and should they take his name away, his whole identity would be lost or annihilated. None of these apprehensions existed in the Pyramid Texts, which have since fallen into disuse; but, we repeat, the deceased must now be forewarned and forearmed against all these dangers, and hence a mass of magical formu- laries has arisen since the Old Kingdom by the proper utter- ance of which the dead may overcome all these foes and live in triumph and security.

All this was written for the use of the deceased on the inside of his coffin, and although no canonical selec- tion of these texts yet existed, they formed the nucleus of what afterward became the Book of the Dead, or, as the Egyptian later called it, ‘‘The Chapters of Going Forth by Day,’’ in reference to their great function of enabling the dead to leave the tomb.

Fragmentary but massive remains of the temple buildings erected by this dynasty in the cities of the northeastern Delta, like Tanis and Nebesheh, show their activity in this region. The needs of the Semitic tribes of neighbouring Asia were already those of highly civilized peoples and gave ample occasion for trade. The tribesmen in the Benihasan tomb wear garments of finely patterned, woven, woolen stuff and sandals of leather, carry metal weapons and use a richly wrought lyre. Already the red pottery produced by the Hittite peoples in Cappadocia, of Asia Minor, was possibly finding its way to the Semites of southern Palestine. Doubtless the commerce along this route, through Palestine, over Carmel and northward to the trade- routes leading down the Euphrates to Babylon, while not yet heavy, was already long existent. Commerce with southern Hurope had also begun. The peoples of the Aigean, whose civilization was now rapidly developing into that of the My- cenean age, were not unknown in Egypt at this time. They were called Haunebu, and a treasurer of the Eleventh Dy- nasty, whose duty was the maintenance of safe frontier ports, boasts of himself as one ‘‘who quells the Haunebu.’” This shows that their intercourse with Egypt was not always 1], p. 281, note d. 2TI Sam., 10: 10, 3T, 493, 1. 26, 494. 41, 493, Il. 16-19, ®T, 428. - -a THE TWELFTH DYNASTY 189 peaceful.

Hurope thus emerges more clearly upon the horizon of the Nile people during the Middle Kingdom. i While Sesostris III’s campaign into Syria was evidently no more than a plundering expedition, as far from achieving the conquest of the country as were the expeditions of the Sixth Dynasty into Nubia, nevertheless it must have added much to the reputation of his house. As the first Pharaoh who had personally led a campaign in a foreign land, the Nubian wars of Sesostris I had brought undying prestige to the name, a prestige which had been greatly increased by the achievements of Sesostris III.

It was called Shet, and lay above the second cataract some thirty or forty miles south of Wadi Halfa, near modern Kummeh.

All appearances would indicate that the successful commander was deposed and disgraced. The country was now sufficiently subjugated, so that the chiefs could be forced to work the mines on the east, in the Wadi Alaki and vicinity, and Ameni of the Oryx-nome was dispatched to Nubia at the head of four hundred troops of his nome to bring back the output of gold. The king im- proved the occasion to send with Ameni the young crown- prince, who afterward became Amenemhet II, in order that he might familiarize himself with the region where he should one day be called upon to continue the process of subjuga- tion and of incorporation into the Pharaoh’s kingdom.° Similarly the gold country on the east of Coptos was now 11, p. 247, note b, 27, 510-514, 31, 520. 182 AUVETSTORY OF: HGYPT exploited, and the faithful Ameni was entrusted with the mission of convoying the vizier, who had been sent thither, to convey the precious metal safely to the Nile valley.

The development of Egypt’s foreign interests was evidently closely watched by Sesostris J, and it is under him that we first hear of inter- course with the oases. While the Pharaoh was not yet able to take possession of them, it is evident that he was in com- munication with their towns. Ikudidi, a steward of Sesos- tris I, was dispatched by him to the great oasis of El Khargeh on the west of Abydos, whence the caravans started thither. His visit in the city of the holy sepulchre of Osiris was an opportunity improved by Ikudidi, as by so many of his colleagues; and he erected a memorial stela there, praying for the favour of the god.

{"context": "These expeditions suffered great hardships and an official of the time describes the difficulties which beset him when some unlucky chance had decreed that he should arrive there in summer. He says that ‘‘although it was not the season for going to this Mine-Land,’’ he went without flinching, and in spite of the fact that ‘‘the high- lands are hot in summer and the mountains brand the skin,’’ he encouraged his workmen who complained of ‘‘this evil summer season,’’ and having accomplished the work brought back more than had been required of him. He left a stela’ there telling of his experience and encouraging those of his posterity who might find themselves in a similar predica- ment. Under such conditions permanent wells and cisterns, barracks for the workmen, houses for the directing officials, and fortifications against the marauding Beduin were indis- pensable. While some of these things may have been already furnished by his predecessors, Amenemhet III made the station at Sarbut el-Khadem a well equipped colony for the exploitation of the mineral wealth of the mountains. He excavated a large cistern in the rocks and opened it with festival celebrations in his forty fourth year.” A temple for the local Hathor was erected, and we find an official of the treasury journeying thither with offerings by water, a fact which shows that the Gulf of Suez was commonly util- ized to avoid the wearisome desert journey.?

The dramatic presentation of the life and death of Osiris at Abydos undoubtedly demanded much dialogue and reci- tation, which must at least have assumed permanent form and have been committed to writing. Unfortunately this, _ the earliest known drama, has perished. It is characteristic of this early world that in neither the art or the literature, of which we have a considerable mass from the Middle King- dom, can we discern any individuals to whom these great works should be attributed. Among all the literary produc- tions which we have enumerated, it is only of the wisdom, the ‘‘instruction,’’ that we know the authors. Of the litera- ture of the age we may say that it now displays a wealth of imagery and a fine mastery of form which five hundred 208 A HISTORY OF EGYPT years earlier, at the close of the Old Kingdom, was but just emerging. The content of the surviving works does not dis- play evidence of constructive ability in the larger sense, in- volving both form and content; it lacks general coherence. It is possible, however, that the Osirian drama, which offered greater constructive opportunity, might have altered this verdict if it had survived. It was thus over a nation in the fullness of its powers, rich and productive in every avenue of life, that Amenemhet III ruled; and his reign crowned the classic age which had dawned with the advent of his family. He seems to have maintained his vigourous grasp of affairs to the end, for he completed the reservoir at Sarbut el-Khadem in Sinai and the great wall of El Kab in the forty fourth year of his reign.

The Delta blossomed under these enlightened rulers, re- freshed as it was by the waters of the Fayum lake which their foresight stored up for summer use. All the Delta cities of all ages, as we have so often mentioned, have per- ished, and but little survives to testify to the activity of these kings there, but in the eastern part, especially at Tanis and Bubastis (Fig. 93), massive remains still show the inter- est which the Twelfth Dynasty manifested in the Delta cities.

The chapel-hall connected with such burials, with its scenes from the life and activity of the departed noble, are our chief source for the history and life of the feudal age. The colonnade which sometimes formed the front of such a tomb was not without architectural merit.

The more ancient and practically contemporary evidence should therefore be questioned first. Two genera- tions after the Hyksos had been expelled from the country the great queen Hatshepsut thus narrated her restoration of the damage which they had wrought: I have restored that which was ruins, I have raised up that which was unfinished, Since the Asiatics were in the midst of Avaris of the Northland | Delta |, And the barbarians were in the midst of them [the people of the Northland], Overthrowing that which had been made, While they ruled in ignorance of Re.’ The still earlier evidence of a soldier in the Egyptian army that expelled the Hyksos shows that a siege of Avaris was necessary to drive them from the country ;? and further that the pursuit of them was continued into southern Palestine‘ and ultimately into Phenicia or Celesyria.> Some four hundred years after their expulsion a folk-tale,* narrating the cause of the final war against them, was circulating among the people.

The sons of the Pharaoh, who in the Old Kingdom held administrative offices, are now generals in the army.* For the next century and a half the story of the achievements of the army will be the story of Egypt, for the army is now the dominant force and the chief motive power in the new state. In organization it quite surpassed the militia of the old days, if for no other reason than that it was now a standing army. It was organized into two grand divisions, one in the Delta and the other in the upper country.* In Syria it had learned tactics and proper strate- gic disposition of forces, the earliest of which we know any- thing in history. We shall now find partition of an army into divisions, we shall hear of wings and centre, we shall even trace a flank movement and define battle lines. All this is fundamentally different from the disorganized plun- dering expeditions naively reported as wars by the monu- ments of the older periods (Fig. 104). Besides the old bow and spear, the troops henceforth carry also a war axe. They have learned archery fire by volleys and the dreaded archers of Egypt now gained a reputation which followed and made them feared even in classic times. But more than this, the Hyksos having brought the horse into Egypt, the Egyptian armies now for the first time possessed a large proportion of chariotry.

Thus we find there the tombs of the lords of Thinis and of Aphroditopolis; a lord of the former city assisted Queen Hatshepsut in the transportation of her obelisks.* There were but few of the local nobles who thus supported Ahmose and gained his favour; the larger number opposed both him and the Hyksos and perished in the struggle.

The lands which formed their heredi- tary possessions were confiscated and passed to the crown, where they permanently remained. There was one notable exception to the general confiscation; the house of El Kab, to which the Theban dynasty owed so much, was allowed te retain its lands, and two generations after the expulsion of the Hyksos, the head of the house appears as lord, not only of Kl Kab but also Esneh and all the intervening terri- tory. Besides this he was given administrative charge, though not hereditary possession, of the lands of the south from the vicinity of Thebes (Per-Hathor) to El Kab. Yet this exception serves but to accentuate more sharply the total extinction of the landed nobility, who had formed the sub- stance of the governmental organization under the Middle Kingdom.

{"context": "At this point the ceaseless campaigns of Thutmose III, as recorded in his Annals, enable us to discern which nation was then playing the leading role there. The great coalition of the kings of Palestine and Syria, with which Thutmose III was called upon to contend at the beginning of his wars, was led and dominated throughout by the powerful king of Kadesh on the Orontes. It required ten years of constant campaign- ing by Thutmose III to achieve the capture of the stubborn city and the subjugation of the kingdom of which it was 1 But see Meyer, Aeg.

The leadership of Kadesh from the beginning to the end of Thutmose III’s campaigns is such as to convey the impression that many Syrian and Palestinian kinglets were its vassals. It is in this Syrian domination of the king of Kadesh that, in the author’s opinion, we should recognize the last nucleus of the Hyksos empire, finally annihilated by the genius of Thutmose III. Hence it was that Thutmose III, the final destroyer of the Hyksos empire, became also the traditional hero who expelled the invaders from Egypt; and as Misphragmouthosis he thus appears in Manetho’s story as the liberator of his country. That it was a Semitic empire we cannot doubt, in view of the Manethonian tra- dition and the subsequent conditions in Syria-Palestine. Moreover the scarabs of a Pharaoh who evidently belonged to the Hyksos time, give his name as Jacob-her or possibly Jacob-El, and it is not impossible that some chief of the Jacob-tribes of Israel for a time gained the leadership in this obscure age. Such an incident would account surpris- ingly well for the entrance of these tribes into Egypt, which on any hypothesis must have taken place at about this age; and in that case the Hebrews in Egypt will have been but a part of the Beduin allies of the Kadesh or Hyksos empire, whose presence there brought into the tradition the partially true belief that the Hyksos were shepherds, and led Manetho to his untenable etymology of the second part of the word.

The latter dealt with social and political factors no longer new in his time, and manipulated to his own ends the old political units without destroying their iden- tity, whereas Ahmose had now to begin with the erection of a fabric of government out of elements so completely di- vorced from the old forms as to have lost their identity, being now in a state of total flux. The course of events, which culminated in the expulsion of the Hyksos, determined for Ahmose the form which the new state was to assume. He was now at the head of a strong army, effectively organ- ized and welded together by long campaigns and sieges pro- tracted through years, during which he had been both general in the field and head of the state. The character of the gov- ernment followed involuntarily out of these conditions. Egypt became a military state. It was quite natural that it should remain so, in spite of the usually unwarlike char- acter of the Egyptian. The long war with the Hyksos had now educated him as a soldier, the large army of Ahmose had spent years in Asia and had even been for a longer or shorter period among the rich cities of Syria. Having thoroughly learned war and having perceived the enormous wealth to be gained by it in Asia, the whole land was roused and stirred with a lust of conquest, which was not quenched for several centuries. The wealth, the rewards and the pro- motion open to the professional soldier were a constant in- centive to a military career, and the middle classes,other- 238 234 A HISTORY OF EGYPT wise so unwarlike, now entered the ranks with ardour.

C., nearly two hundred years after the fall of the Twelfth Dynasty, that the Sekenenre of the folk-tale! was ruling in Thebes under the suzerainty of a Hyksos Apophis in Avaris. This tale, as eurrent four hundred years later in Ramessid days, is our only source for the events that immediately followed. After its account of the Hyksos, which the reader will recall as quoted above, there follows the brief description of a sacred feast, and later a council of Apophis and his wise men; but what took place at this council is quite uncertain. It con- cerned a plot or design against king Sekenenre, however, for the story then proceeds: ‘‘Now many days after this, king Apophis sent to the prince [king Sekenenre] of the Southern City [Thebes] the report which his scribes and wise men had communicated to him. Now when the mes- senger whom king Apophis had sent reached the prince of the Southern City, he was taken to the prince of the Southern City. Then said one to the messengers of king Apophis, ‘What brings thee to the Southern City, and wherefore hast thou joined them that journey?’ The messenger said to him, ‘It is king Apophis who sends to thee, saying: ‘‘One [that is the messenger] has come [to thee] concerning the pool of the hippopotami, which is in the city [Thebes]. For they permit me no sleep, day and night the noise of them is In my ear.’’’ Then the prince of the Southern City lamented a [long] time, and it came to pass that he could not return [answer] to the messenger of king Apophis.’’ 1 Infra, pp. 215-16. 223 224 A HISTORY .OF EGYPT The surviving fragments at this point would indicate that Sekenenre now sent gifts to Apophis and promised to do all that he demanded, after which, ‘‘[the messenger of king] Apophis betook himself away, to proceed to the place where his lord was. Then the prince of the Southern City caused to summon his great princes, likewise his officers and leaders . . , and he recounted to them all the matters concerning which king Apophis had sent to him.

{"context": "Arabians and Pheenicians; and con- temporary monuments designated as ‘‘ Asiatics,’’ ‘‘barbar- ians,’’ and ‘‘rulers of countries.’’ An Apophis, one of their kings, fashioned an altar, now at Cairo, and engraved upon it the dedication: ‘‘He [Apophis] made it as his monument for his father Sutekh, lord of Avaris, when he [Sutekh] 218 A HISTORY OF EGYPT set all lands under his [the king’s] feet.’’! General as is the statement it would appear that this Apophis ruled over more than the land of Egypt. More significant are the mon- uments of Khian, the most remarkable of this line of kings. They have been found from Gebelen in southern Egypt to the northern Delta; but they do not stop here. Under a Mycenzan wall in the palace of Cnossos in Crete an alabas- ter vase-lid bearing his name was discovered by Mr. Evans ;? while a granite lion with his cartouche upon the breast, found many years ago at Bagdad, is now in the British Museum. One of his royal names was ‘‘Eincompasser [liter- ally ‘embracer’] of the Lands,’’ and we recall that his con- stant title upon his scarabs and cylinders is ‘‘ruler of coun- tries.’’ Scarabs of the Hyksos rulers have been turned up by the excavations in southern Palestine. Meagre as these data are, one cannot contemplate them without seeing con- jured up before him the vision of a vanished empire which once stretched from the Euphrates to the first cataract of the Nile, an empire of which all other evidence has perished, for the reason that Avaris, the capital of its rulers, was in the Delta, where, like so many other Delta cities, it suffered a destruction so complete that we cannot even locate the spot on which it once stood. There was, moreover, every reason why the victorious Egyptians should annihilate all evidence of the supremacy of their hated conquerors. In the light of these developments it becomes evident why the invaders did not set up their capital in the midst of the conquered land, but remained in Avaris, on the extreme east of the Delta, close to the borders of Asia. It was that they might rule not only Egypt, but also their Asiatic dominions. Ac- cepting the above probabilities, we can also understand how the Hyksos could retire to Asia and withstand the Egyptian onset for six years in southern Palestine, as we know from contemporary evidence * they did.

All the products which filled these repositories were termed ‘‘labour,’’ the word employed in ancient Egypt as we use ‘‘taxes.’’ If we may accept Hebrew tradition as transmitted in the story of Joseph, such taxes comprised one fifth of the produce of the land.’ It was collected by the local officials, whom we have already noticed, and its reception in and payment from the various magazines de- manded a host of scribes and subordinates, now more numer- ous than ever before in the history of the country. The chief treasurer at their head was under the authority of the vizier, to whom he made a report every morning, after which he received permission to open the offices and magazines for the day’s business.” The collection of a second class of revenue, that paid by the local officials themselves as a tax upon their offices, was exclusively in the hands of the viziers. The southern vizier was responsible for all the officials of Upper Egypt in his jurisdiction from Elephantine to Siut;* and in view of this fact, the other vizier doubtless bore a similar responsibility in the North. This tax on the officials consisted chiefly of gold, silver, grain, cattle and linen; the mayor of the old city of El Kab, for example, paid some 5,600 grains of gold, 4,200 grains of silver, one ox and one ‘‘two-year old’’ into the vizier’s oifice every year, while his subordinate paid 4,200 grains of silver, a bead necklace of gold, two oxen and two chests of linen.

It was no longer possible for the mayor of Nekhen to administer Nubia and collect the tribute. The country demanded the sole attention of a responsible governor who was practically a viceroy. He was given the title ‘‘Governor of the south countries, king’s-son of Kush,’’ although he was not necessarily a member of the royal house- hold or of royal birth. With great ceremony, in the presence of the Pharaoh, one of the treasury officials was wont to deliver to the incumbent the seal of his new office, saying: ‘This is the seal from the Pharaoh, who assigns to thee the territory from Nekhen to Napata.’’? The jurisdiction of the viceroy thus extended to the fourth cataract, and it was the region between this southern limit and the second cataract which was known as Kush.

With the state religion, the foreign dynasty had shown no sympathy and the temples lay wasted and deserted in many places. We find Ahmose therefore in his twenty second year opening new workings in the famous quarries of Ayan or Troja, opposite Gizeh, from which the blocks for the Gizeh pyramids were taken, in order to secure stone for the tem- ples in Memphis, Thebes (Luxor) and probably elsewhere.! For these works he still employed the oxen which he had taken from the Syrians in his Asiatic wars. None of these buildings of his, however, has survived. For the ritual of the state temple at Karnak he furnished the sanctuary with a magnificent service of rich cultus utensils in precious metals, and he built a new temple-barge upon the river of cedar exacted from the Lebanon princes.?_ His greatest work remains the Highteenth Dynasty itself, for whose brilliant career his own achievements had laid so firm a foundation. Notwithstanding his reign of at least twenty two years, Ahmose must have died young (1557 B. C.) for his mother was still living in the tenth year of his son and successor, Amenhotep I.

It was no longer possible for the mayor of Nekhen to administer Nubia and collect the tribute. The country demanded the sole attention of a responsible governor who was practically a viceroy. He was given the title ‘‘Governor of the south countries, king’s-son of Kush,’’ although he was not necessarily a member of the royal house- hold or of royal birth. With great ceremony, in the presence of the Pharaoh, one of the treasury officials was wont to deliver to the incumbent the seal of his new office, saying: ‘This is the seal from the Pharaoh, who assigns to thee the territory from Nekhen to Napata.’’? The jurisdiction of the viceroy thus extended to the fourth cataract, and it was the region between this southern limit and the second cataract which was known as Kush. There was still no great or domi- nant kingdom in Kush, nor in lower Nubia, but the country was under the rule of powerful chiefs, each controlling a limited territory.

Moreover, in Thutmose I’s time the southern half of the new province was far from being sufficiently pacified. The appointment of Thure, the first viceroy, therefore brought him a serious task. The turbulent tribes from the hills above the Nile valley were constantly raiding the towns along the river’? and making stable government and the orderly development of the coun- try’s natural resources impossible. Seeing that Thure was unable to stop this, the king went south early in his second year personally to oversee the task of more thorough sub- jJugation.

There thus grew up a new official class, its lower ranks drawn from the old middle class, while on the other hand in its upper strata were the relatives and dependents of the old landed nobility, by whom the higher and more important local offices were administered. Here the official class gradually merged into the large circle of royal favourites who filled the great offices of the central government or commanded the Pharaoh’s forces on his campaigns. As there was no longer a feudal nobility, the great government officials became the nobles of the Empire. The old middle class of merchants,' skilled craftsmen and artists also still survived and continued to replenish the lower ranks of the official class. Below these were the masses who worked the fields and estates, the serfs of the Pharaoh. They formed so large a portion of the inhabitants that the Hebrew scribe, evidently writing from the outside, knew only this class of society beside the priests.’ These lower strata passed away and left little or no trace, but the official class was now able to erect tombs and mor- tuary stele in such surprising numbers that they furnish us a vast mass of materials for reconstructing the life and customs of the time. An official who took a census in the Eighteenth Dynasty divided the people into ‘‘soldiers, priests, royal serfs and all the craftsmen,’’* and this clas- sification is corroborated by all that we know of the time; although we must understand that all callings of the free middle class are here included among the ‘‘soldiers.’’ The soldier in the standing army has therefore now also become a social class.

The priests bore the god around both sides of the colonnade, as if he were looking for some one, and he finally stopped before the young prince, who prostrated him- self upon the pavement. But the god raised him up, and as an indication of his will, had him placed immediately in the ‘‘Station of the King,’’ which was the ceremonial spot where only the king might stand in the celebration of the temple ritual.

Everything thus conspired to favour the permanence of Egyptian power there.

None of his records of the campaign has survived, but the two Ahmoses of El Kab were still serving with the army of conquest and in their biographies they refer briefly to this war also. Kadesh must have been cowed for the time by Amenhotep I, for, in so far as we know, Thutmose met with no resistance from her, which the two Ahmoses considered worthy of mention. Thus, without serious opposition, the Pharaoh reached Naharin, or the land of the ‘‘rivers,’’ as the name signifies, which was the designation of the country from the Orontes to the Euphrates and beyond, merging into Asia Minor. Here the revolt was naturally the most serious as it was farthest removed from the Pharaoh’s vengeance. The battle resulted in a great slaughter of the Asiatics, followed by the capture of large numbers of prisoners. ‘‘Meanwhile,’’ says Ahmose, 264 A HISTORY OF EGYPT son of Ebana, ‘‘I was at the head of our troops and his majesty beheld my bravery. I brought off a chariot, its horses and him who was upon it as a living prisoner, and I took them to his majesty. One presented me with gold in double measure.’’!

Here he makes no reference to any coregency of Hatshepsut, his queen, in the royal titulary preceding the dedication. Indeed he allowed her no more honourable title than ‘‘great or chief royal wife.’? But the party of legitimacy was not to be so easily put off. The nomination of Hatshepsut to the succession some fifteen years before, and, what was still more important, her descent from the old Theban family of the Sekenenres and the Ahmoses, were things taken seriously by the nobles of this party. As a result of their efforts Thutmose III was forced to acknowl- edge the coregency of his queen and actually to give her a share in the government. Before long her partisans had become so strong that the king was seriously hampered, and eventually even thrust into the background. Hatshepsut thus became king, an enormity with which the state fiction of the Pharaoh’s origin could not be harmonized. / She was ealled ‘‘the female Horus!’’ The word ‘‘majesty’’ was put into a feminine form (as in Egyptian it agrees with the sex of the ruler) and the conventions of the court were all warped and distorted to suit the rule of a woman Hatshepsut immediately undertook independent works and royal monuments, especially a magnificent temple for her own mortuary service, which she erected in a bay of the cliffs on the west side of the river at Thebes.

As a discreet reminder to any who might be inclined to oppose the queen’s rule, these inscrip- tions were so framed by the queen’s party that they rep- resent Thutmose I as saying to the court, ‘‘Ye shall pro- claim her word, ye shall be united at her command. He who shall do her homage shall live, he who shall speak evil in blasphemy of her majesty shall die.’’* On the pylon, which Thutmose I built as a southern approach to the Karnak temple, he was even depicted before the Theban gods praying for a prosperous reign for his daughter.’ With such devices as these it was sought to overcome the prejudice against a queen upon the throne of the Pharaohs.

In a series of three terraces it rose from the plain to the level of an elevated court, flanked by the massive yellow cliffs, into which the holy of holies was cut. In front of the terraces were ranged fine colonnades, which, when seen from a distance, to this day exhibit such an exquisite sense of proportion and of proper grouping, as to quite disprove the common assertion that the Greeks were the first to understand the art of adjust- ing external colonnades, and that the Egyptian understood only the employment of the column in interiors (Fig. 113).

The news of his great victory of the year before had by this time reached Assyria, now just rising on the eastern horizon, with her career as yet all before her. Her king naturally desired to be on good terms with the great empire of the west, and the gifts of costly stone, chiefly lapis- lazuli from Babylon, and the horses which he sent to Thut- mose, so that they reached him while on this campaign, were, of course, interpreted by the Egyptians as tribute.’ In all probability no battles were fought on this expedition. Returning to Thebes as before, in October, the king imme- diately planned for the enlargement of the Karnak temple, to suit the needs of the empire of which he dreamed. Moreover the slowly rising bed of the river had now raised the waters of the inundation until they invaded the temple area, and it had become necessary to elevate the temple pavement. The splendid gate of Amenhotep I was sacrificed to this necessity. By the latter part of February, at the feast of the new moon, which happened by a lucky chance to fall upon the day of the tenth feast of Amon, he was able personally to celebrate the foundation-ceremonies with the greatest splendour.* To render the act especially auspicious the god appeared and even himself participated in the stretching of the measuring cord as the foundation- plan was laid out.t As the west end, the real front of the temple, was marred by Hatshepsut’s obelisks, rising from his father’s dismantled hall, and he was unable or unwilling to build around his father’s obelisks, which stood before the western entrance of the temple, Thutmose", "question": "What was Thutmose III's main strategic objective in Asia immediately following his first campaign?", "answer": "Thutmose III's primary focus after his first campaign was to properly organize and secure the states already under Egypt's power, rather than immediately attacking Kadesh, due to Egyptian power in Asia being shaken during Hatshepsut's reign."}

The frightful destruction of whole cities, of which the Assyrian kings boasted when recounting their treatment of rebels, is nowhere found among the records of the Pharaohs. To compensate for the failure to capture the dangerous king of Kadesh himself, they secured his family as hostages; for Thutmose says, ‘‘Lo, my majesty carried off the wives of that vanquished one, together with his children, and the wives of the chiefs who were there, together with their children.’’* Rich as had been the spoil on the battle-field, it was not to be compared with the wealth which awaited the Pharaoh in the captured city.

Senmut was even allowed to depict himself on one of the walls praying to Hathor for the queen, an unparalleled honour.’ This unique temple was in its function the culmination of a new development in the arrangement and architecture of the royal tomb and its chapel or temple. Perhaps because they had other uses for their resources, perhaps because they recognized the futility of so vast a tomb, which yet failed to preserve from violation the body of the builder, the Pharaoh, as we have seen, had gradually abandoned the con- struction of a pyramid. With its mortuary chapel on the east front, it had survived probably into the reign of Ahmose I, but it had been gradually declining in size and importance, while the shaft and chambers under it and the chapel before it remained relatively large. Amenhotep I was the last to follow the old traditions; he pierced a passage two hundred feet long into the western cliffs of Thebes, terminating in a mortuary chamber for the reception of the royal body.* Before the cliff, at the entrance to the passage, he built a modest mortuary chapel, surmounted by a pyramidal roof, to which we have already adverted.? Probably for purposes of safety Thutmose I then took the radical step of separating the tomb from the mortuary chapel before it. The latter was still left upon the plain at the foot of the cliffs, but the sepulchre chamber, with the passage leading to it (Figs. 109-10) was hewn into the rocky wall of a wild and desolate valley (Fig. 108), lying behind the western cliffs, some two miles in a direct line from the river, and accessible only by a long detour northward, involving nearly twice that dis- tance. It is evident that the exact spot where the king’s body was entombed was intended to be kept secret, that all possibility of robbing the royal burial might be precluded. 1 See p. 275; II, 246-295. ?

From that time until we find him marching into Asia, late in the year twenty two, we are not informed of what took place there; but the conditions which then con- fronted him and the course of his subsequent campaigns, make it evident how matters had gone with Egyptian su- premacy during the interim. Not having seen an Egyptian army for many years, the Syrian dynasts grew continually more restless, and finding that their boldness called forth no response from the Pharaoh, the king of Kadesh, once prob- ably the suzerain of all Syria-Palestine, had stirred all the city-kings of northern Palestine and Syria to accept his leadership in a great coalition, in which they at last felt them- selves strong enough to begin open revolt. Kadesh thus assumed its head with a power in which we should evidently recognize the surviving prestige of her old time more ex- tended and unchallenged suzerainty. ‘‘Behold from Yeraza [in northern Judea] to the marshes of the earth [upper Euphrates], they had begun to revolt against his majesty.’’? But southern Palestine was loth to take up arms against the Pharaoh. Sharuhen, which had suffered a six years’ siege at the hands of Ahmose in Hyksos days, was too well aware of what to expect thoughtlessly to assume the offensive against Kgypt. Hence the whole region of southern Palestine, which had witnessed that siege, was not differently minded, but a small minority probably desired to join the revolt.

The valley, now known as the ‘‘ Valley of the Kings’ Tombs’’ rapidly filled with the vast excavations of Thutmose I’s successors. It continued to be the cemetery of the EKighteenth,Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties, and over forty tombs of the Theban kings were excavated there. Forty one now accessible form one of the wonders which attract the modern Nile-tourists to Thebes, and Strabo speaks of forty which were worthy to be visited in his time. Hatshepsut’s terraced sanctuary was therefore her mortuary temple, dedicated also to her father. As the tombs multi- plied in the valley behind, there rose upon the plain before it temple after temple endowed for the mortuary service of the departed gods, the emperors who had once ruled Egypt. They were besides also sacred to Amon as the state god; but they bore euphemistic names significant of their mor- tuary function.

The last two, which commemorate his fourth jubilee-celebration now rise on opposite shores of the Atlantic, as they once stood on either side of the approach to the sun-temple at Heliopolis.* With such monuments as these before them the people of Thebes soon forgot that he who erected them was once a humble priest in the very temple where his giant obelisks now rose.

{"context": "All was now in readiness for the long planned advance upon Kadesh. It had taken five campaigns to gain the south and the coast; the sixth was at last directed against his long invulnerable enemy. In the year thirty the close of the spring rains found Thutmose disembarking his army from the fleet at Simyra,’ by the mouth of the Eleutheros, up the valley of which he immediately marched upon Kadesh.° It was a convenient and easy road, and the shortest route from the sea to Kadesh to be found anywhere along the coast; indeed it was then, as it is now, the only practicable highway for a military advance inland across the mountains toward the region of Kadesh. The city lay on the west side of the Orontes river at the north end of the high valley between the two Leb- anons, the ridge of Anti-Lebanon dropping to the plain just south and east of the town (Maps 5, 7). A small tributary of the Orontes from the west joined the larger stream just below the city, so that it lay on a point of land between the two. A canal, still traceable and doubtless in existence in Thutmose’s day, was cut across the tongue of land above the town, thus connecting the two streams and entirely sur- rounding the place by water. An inner moat encircling the high curtain-walls within the banks of the rivers reénforced the natural water-defences, so that, in spite of its location in 1 Thid. 2TI, 462. 3 Tbid. ‘TI, 460. 5 TJ, 463.

This was the road up the Eleutheros valley, along which we have fol- lowed Thutmose.‘ The capture of such a place by siege was !

{"context": "No records of the fourth campaign have survived, but the course of his subsequent operations was such that it must have been confined like the others to the territory already regained. It had now become evident to Thutmose that he could not march northward between the Lebanons and oper- ate against Kadesh, while leaving his flank exposed to the unsubdued Pheenician cities of the coast. It was likewise impossible to strike Naharin and Mitanni without first de- stroying Kadesh, which dominated the Orontes valley. He therefore planned a series of campaigns, directed first against the northern coast, which he might then use as a base of oper- ations against Kadesh; and this being once disposed of, he could again push in from the coast against Mitanni and the whole Naharin region. No modern strategist could have con- ceived a series of operations better suited to the conditions, nor have gone about putting them into execution with more 11I, 604-5. 211, 450-52. 298 A HISTORY OF EGYPT indomitable energy than Thutmose now displayed. He therefore organized a fleet and placed in command of it a trusty officer named Nibamon, who had served with his father.’ In the year twenty nine, on his fifth campaign, he moved for the first time against the northern coast cities, the wealthy commercial kingdoms of Phenicia. He must have employed the new fleet and transported his army by sea, for he began operations in northern Pheenicia, which, with all southern Pheenicia and Kadesh still unconquered, he could not have reached by land. It is possible that he gained his first foothold by offering to Tyre special inducements to submit, for it is evident that some Pharaoh granted this city exceptional privileges, making it practically a free city.2_ It is easily conceivable that the rich harbour-town would readily embrace the opportunity to save her commerce from destruc- tion and escape tribute, or at least a portion of the usual obligation in the future. The name of the first city which Thutmose took is unfortunately lost, but it was on the coast opposite Tunip, and must have been a place of considerable importance, for it brought him rich spoils; and there was in the town a temple of Amon,’ erected by one of Thutmose III’s predecessors (either Thutmose I or possibly Amenhotep I). The cities of the interior, seeing that this attack from the coast must be fatal to them if successful, had sent troops to assist in its defense. Thus", "question": "What details are known about the first coastal city captured by Thutmose III during his fifth campaign?", "answer": "The name of the first city Thutmose III captured on the coast is lost, but it was opposite Tunip, of considerable importance due to the rich spoils it yielded, and contained a temple of Amon that had been erected by one of Thutmose III’s predecessors (either Thutmose I or Amenhotep I)."}

In the garden of Amon’s temple, as we have seen, grew the strange plants of Syria-Palestine, while animals unknown to the hunter of the Nile valley wandered among trees equally unfamiliar. Envoys from the north and south were con- stantly appearing at the court. Phcenician galleys, such as the upper Nile had never seen before delighted the eyes of the curious crowd at the docks of Thebes; and from these landed whole cargoes of the finest stuffs of Phcenicia, gold and silver vessels of magnificent workmanship, from the cunning hand of the Tyrian artificer or the workshops of distant Asia Minor, Cyprus, Crete and the A\\gean islands; exquisite furniture of carved ivory, delicately wrought ebony, chariots mounted with gold and electrum, and bronze implements of war; besides these, fine horses for the Phar- aoh’s stables and untold quantities of the best that the fields, gardens, vineyards, orchards and pastures of Asia produced. Under heavy guard emerged from these ships, too, the annual tribute of gold and silver in large commercial rings, some of which weighed as much as twelve pounds each, while others for purposes of daily trade were of but a few grains weight. Winding through the streets, crowded with the wondering Theban multitude, the strange tongued Asiatics in long pro- cession bore their tribute to the Pharaoh’s treasury.

It was such scenes as this that the vizier and treasury officials loved to perpetu- ate in gorgeous paintings on the walls of their tombs, where they are still preserved at Thebes! (Fig. 118).

The troops, of course, found rich plunder on the field: horses, bronze armour and weapons, besides chariots richly wrought with gold and silver. The alliance of the Naharin dynasts was completely shattered and its resources for future resist- ance destroyed or carried. off by the victorious Egyptians.

On this expedition he received not only another gift from the king of Cyprus, but also one from far off Arrapakhitis, later a province of Assyria.? The turbulent Beduin of southern Palestine forced him to march through their country the next year, and the inevitable Amenemhab captured three pris- oners in an action in the Negeb.* He then spent the rest of this fourteenth campaign in Syria, where it became merely a tour of inspection; but in both years he kept the harbours supplied as before, ready for every emergency. The tribute seems to have come in regularly for the next two years (forty and forty one),* and again the king of ‘‘ Kheta the great’’ sent gifts, which Thutmose as before records among the ‘‘tribute.’’® The princes of Syria, sorely chastised as they had been, were nevertheless unwilling to relinquish finally their independ- ence, and regard the suzerainty of Egyptas an inevitable and permanent condition of their rule. Incited by Kadesh, Thut- mose’s inveterate enemy, they again rose in a final united effort to shake off the Pharaoh’s strong hand. All Naharin, especially the king of Tunip, and also some of the northern coast cities, had been induced to join the alliance.", "question": "What was the outcome of Thutmose III's battle against the Naharin dynasts, and how long did the peace last?", "answer": "The alliance of the Naharin dynasts was completely shattered, and their resources for future resistance were destroyed or carried off by the victorious Egyptians.

How much he has passed over, the biography of Amenemhab shows only too well; and thus all that we have of the wars of Egypt’s greatest commander has filtered through the shrivelled soul of an ancient bureaucrat, who little dreamed how hungrily future ages would ponder his meagre excerpts. The advancement of Egypt’s Asiatic frontier to the Kuphrates again was, in the light of past experience, not an achievement from which he might expect lasting results; nor was Thutmose III the man to drop the work he had begun as if it were complete with the campaign of the year thirty three. The spring of the thirty fourth year therefore found him again in Zahi on his ninth campaign.* Some dis- affection, probably in the Lebanon region, obliged him to take three towns, one of which at least was in the district of Nuges, where he had erected a fortress at the close of the first campaign.‘ Considerable spoil was captured and the Syrian dynasts as usual hastened to pay their tribute and express their loyalty.© Meanwhile the magazines of the harbour-towns were replenished as formerly, but especially with ships for the fleet, and with masts and spars for naval repairs. The tribute of the year was rendered notable by a present of one hundred and eight blocks of copper, weigh- ing nearly four pounds apiece, beside some lead and costly stones from the king of Cyprus, who had not heretofore rec- ognized the might of Thutmose in this manner.’", "question": "Why are the historical records of Thutmose III on the Karnak temple walls considered incomplete by historians?", "answer": "The Karnak temple records are considered meager excerpts because they were made by priests who were more concerned with explaining the source of the temple's gifts and showing Amon's share of the spoil, rather than perpetuating a full narrative of the king's great deeds."}

We shall later see how this captive labour transformed Thebes. The return of the king every autumn, under such circum- stances, with the next campaign but six months distant, began for him a winter, if not so arduous, at least as busily occupied as the campaigning season in Asia. At the time of the feast of Opet, that is in October, shortly after his return, Thutmose made a tour of inspection throughout Egypt, closely questioning the local authorities wherever he landed, for the purpose of suppressing corruption in the local administration by preventing all collusion between them and the officers of the central government in extor- tionate oppression of the people while collecting taxes.? On these journeys, too, he had opportunity of observing the progress on the noble temples which he was either erecting, restoring or adorning at over thirty different places of which we know, and many more which have perished. He revived the long neglected Delta and from there to the third cataract his buildings were rising, strung like gems, along the river. He built a new town with its temple at the mouth of the Fayum; while at Dendereh, Coptos, Hl Kab, Edfu, Kom Ombo, Elephantine and many other places his captives of war and his imperial revenues were producing the magnifi- eent works which he and his architects planned.

For the last time in Asia he received the envoys of the tribute-paying princes in his tent,* and then returned to Egypt. There the Nubian envoys brought him over five hundred and seventy eight pounds of gold from Wawat alone. * One would have thought that the old king might now enjoy a well-earned repose for the few years that remained to him; but having at last established the sovereignty of Egypt in Asia on a permanent basis, he turned his attention to Nubia. It is evident that Menkheperreseneb, the head of his gold and silver treasury, was now receiving thence six to eight hun- dred pounds of gold every year, for, as we now see, even the incomplete data at our command show in his forty first year nearly eight hundred pounds.® His viceroy, Nehi, had now been administering Kush for twenty years’ and had placed the productivity of the country on a high plane; but it was the desire of the great king to extend still further his dominions in the south. In his last years his buildings show that he was extremely active throughout the province; as far as the third cataract we trace his temples at Kalabsheh, Amada, Wadi Halfa, Kummeh and Semneh, where he re- stored the temple of his great ancestor Sesostris III, and at 1 Amarna Letters, ed.

It is impossible to suppose that the aged Thutmose accompanied it. There must have been earlier expeditions also in the same region, for Thut- mose was able to record in duplicate upon the pylons of his Karnak temple a list of one hundred and fifteen places which he conquered in Nubia and another containing some four hundred such names.

While he was proud to leave a record of his unparalleled achievements, Thutmose protests more than once his deep respect for the truth in so doing. ‘‘I have not uttered exaggeration,’’ says he, ‘‘in order to boast of that which I did, saying, ‘I have done something,’ although my majesty had not done it. I have not done anything... against which contradiction might be uttered. I have done this for my father, Amon . . . because he knoweth heaven and he knoweth earth, he seeth the whole earth hourly.’’?

The old seclusiveness had totally disappeared, the wall of partition between Asia and Africa, already shaken by the Hyksos, was now broken down completely by the wars of Thutmose III. Traditional limits disappeared, the cur- rents of life eddied no longer within the landmarks of tiny kingdoms, but pulsed from end to end of a great empire, embracing many kingdoms and tongues, from the upper Nile to the upper Euphrates. The wealth of Asiatic trade, cir- culating through the eastern end of the Mediterranean, which once flowed down the Euphrates to Babylon, was thus di- verted to the Nile Delta, centuries earlier united by canal with the Red Sea. All the world traded in the Delta mar- kets. Assyria was still in her infancy and Babylonia no longer possessed any political influence in the west. The Pharaoh looked forward to an indefinite lease of power throughout the vast empire which he had conquered. Of his administration in Asia we know very little. The whole region was under the general control of a ‘‘governor of the north countries’’; Thutmose III’s general, Thutiy, being the first to hold that office. To bridle the turbulent Asiatic dynasts it was necessary permanently to station troops throughout Syria-Palestine.

The work of Amenhotep’s great father was so thoroughly done, however, that, as far as we know, he was not obliged to invade either Asia or Nubia again. In Thebes he built his now vanished mortuary temple on the west side of the river, by that of his father, while in the Karnak temple he restored the long dismantled hall of Hatshepsut’s obelisks, setting up again the columns which she had removed and richly adorning them with precious metal. He recorded the restoration on the wall which his father had built around the obelisks of Hatshepsut to hide their inscriptions forever from view.? Besides a small col- onnaded structure at Karnak, he also built at Memphis and Heliopolis, restoring the neighbouring quarries of Troja; but all his works there have perished. We are able to discern little of him personally, but he seems to have been a worthy son of the great king. Physically he was a very powerful man and claims in his inscriptions that no man could draw his bow.

Five letters? survive from the corre- spondence of Amenhotep III with Kallimma-Sin (Kadash- man-Bel), king of Babylonia, one from the Pharaoh and the others from Kallimma-Sin. The Babylonian king is con- stantly in need of gold and insistently importunates his 1 Amarna, Letters, 7. 2 Amarna Letters, 1-5, THE EMPIRE 333 brother of Egypt to send him large quantities of the precious metal, which he says is as plentiful as dust in Egypt accord- ing to the reports of the Babylonian messengers. Consid- erable friction results from the dissatisfaction of Kallimma- Sin at the amounts with which Amenhotep favours him. He refers to the fact that Amenhotep had received from his father a daughter in marriage, and makes this relationship a reason for further gifts of gold. As the correspondence goes on another marriage is negotiated between a daughter of Amenhotep and Kallimma-Sin or his son. Similarly Amenhotep enjoys the most intimate connection with Shut- tarna, the king of Mitanni, the son of Artatama, with whom his father, Thutmose IV, had enjoyed the most cordial rela- tions. Indeed Amenhotep was perhaps the nephew of Shut- tarna, from whom he now received a daughter, named Gilukhipa, in marriage. In celebration of this union Amen- hotep issued a series of scarab-beetles of stone bearing an inscription commemorating the event, and stating that the princess brought with her a train of three hundred and seventeen ladies and attendants.’ This occurred in Amen- hotep’s tenth year. On the death of Shuttarna the alliance was continued under his son, Dushratta, from whom Amen- hotep later received, as a wife for his son and successor, a second Mitannian princess, Tadukhipa, the daughter of Dushratta. The correspondence between the two kings is very illuminating and may serve as an example of such com- munications. The following is a letter? of Dushratta to his Egyptian ally: ““To Nimmuria, the great king, the king of Egypt, my brother, my son-in-law, who loves me, and whom I love:— Dushratta, the great king, thy father-in-law, who loves thee, the king of Mitanni, thy brother.

Syria thus enjoyed a stability of gov- ernment which had never before been hers.

It was deemed sufficient, as we shall later see, to send troops under the command of an efficient officer, who found no difficulty in coping with the situation for a generation after Amenhotep’s accession. Thus one of the vassal princes later wrote to Amenhotep’s son: ‘‘Verily, thy father did not march forth, nor inspect the lands of his vassal princes.’’? Under such circumstances Amenhotep was at leisure to devote himself to those enterprises of peace which have occu- pied all emperors under similar conditions. ‘Trade now developed as never before.

On New Year’s Day the king presented his nobles with a profusion of costly gifts which would have amazed the Pharachs of the pyra- mid-age. On one such occasion the chief treasurer carried in before the monarch ‘‘chariots of silver and gold, statues of ivory and ebony, necklaces of every costly stone, weapons of warfare, and work of all craftsmen.’’ They included thirteen statues of the king, seven sphinx portraits of the monarch, eight superb necklaces, six hundred and eighty richly wrought shields and two hundred and thirty quivers of the same workmanship, three hundred and sixty bronze swords and one hundred and forty bronze daggers, both damascened with precious metal, thirty ebony staves tipped with silver and gold, two hundred and twenty ivory and ebony whips, seven elaborately wrought chests, many sun- shades, chairs, vases and innumerable small objects.2 In the old days the monarch rewarded a faithful noble with land, which, in order to pay a return, must be properly cul- tivated and administered, thus fostering simplicity and wholesome country virtues on a large domain; but the favourite now received convertible wealth, which required no administration to be utilized.

It plays in the new faith a similar important part, which we find it assuming in the early cosmogonic philoso- phies of the Greeks. Thence, as we might expect, the god is stated to be everywhere active by means of his ‘‘rays,”’ and his symbol is a disk in the heavens, darting earthward numerous diverging rays which terminate in hands, each grasping the symbol of life. In his age of the world it is perfectly certain that the king could not have had the vaguest notion of the physico-chemical aspects of his assumption any more than had the early Greeks in dealing with a similar thought; yet the fundamental idea is surprisingly true, and, as we shall see, marvellously fruitful. The outward symbol of his god thus broke sharply with tradition, but it was capable of practical introduction in the many different nations making up the empire and could be understood at a glance by any intelligent foreigner, which was far from the case with any of the traditional symbols of Egyptian ~ religion (Figs. 139-40). The new god could not dispense with a temple like those of the older deities whom he was ultimately to supersede. Early in his reign Amenhotep IV sent an expedition to the sandstone quarries of Silsileh to secure the necessary stone and the chief nobles of his court were in charge of the works at the quarry.’ In the garden of Amon, which his father had laid out between the temples of Karnak and Luxor, Amenhotep located his new temple, which was a large and stately building, adorned with polychrome reliefs. Thebes was now called ‘‘City of the Brightness of Aton,’’ and the temple-quarter ‘‘Brightness of Aton the Great’’; while the sanctuary itself bore the name ‘‘Gem-Aton,’’ a term of uncer- tain meaning.” Although the other gods were still tolerated as of old,* it was nevertheless inevitable that the priesthood of Amon should view with growing jealousy the brilliant rise 111, 935.", "question": "Where did Amenhotep IV choose to build the new temple for Aton in Thebes?", "answer": "Amenhotep IV located his new temple for Aton in the garden of Amon, which his father had laid out between the temples of Karnak and Luxor in Thebes."}

Early Greek philosophy may also have drawn upon it. Similar ideas were now being propagated regarding all the greater gods of Egypt, but as long as the kingdom was confined to the Nile valley the activity of such a god was limited, in their thinking, to the confines of the Pharaoh’s domain, and the world of which they thought meant no more. From of old the Pharaoh was the heir of the gods and ruled the two kingdoms of the upper and lower river which they had once ruled. Thus they had not in the myths extended their dominion beyond the river valley, and that valley origi- nally extended only from the sea to the first cataract. But under the Empire all this is changed, the god goes where the Pharaoh’s sword carries him; the advance of the Pharaoh’s boundary-tablets in Nubia and Syria is the extension of the god’s domain. The king is now called ‘‘The one who brings the world to him [the god], who placed him [the Pharaoh] on his throne.’’? For king and priest alike the world is only a great domain of the god. All the Pharaoh’s wars are recorded upon the temple walls, and even in their mechanical arrangement his wars converge upon the temple door.* The 111, 770. 2TI, 959, 1. 3; 1000. 3 III, 80.

But none of the old divinities of Egypt had been proclaimed the god of the empire, although in fact the priesthood of Heliopolis had gained the coveted honour for their revered sun-god, Re. Already under Amenhotep III an old name for the material sun, ‘‘ Aton,’’ had come into prominent use, where the name of the sun-god might have been expected. Thus he called the royal barge on which he sailed with Tiy on her beautiful lake, ‘‘ Aton Gleams.’”! A company of his body-guard bore the new god’s name, and there was probably a chapel dedicated to him at Heliopolis. The sun-god, too, was now and again designated as ‘‘the sole god’’ by Amenhotep III’s contemporaries. The already existent conflict with traditional tendencies into which the Pharaoh had been forced, contained in itself difficulties enough to tax the resources of any statesman without the introduction of a departure involving the most dangerous conflicts with the powerful priesthoods and touch- ing religious tradition, the strongest conservative force of the: time. It was just this rash step which the young king now had no hesitation in taking. Under the name of Aton, then, Amenhotep IV introduced the worship of the supreme god, but he made no attempt to conceal the identity of his new deity with the old sun-god, Re. Instructing his vizier in the new faith, he said to him, ‘‘The words of Re are before thee ... my august father who taught me their essence. . . . It was known in my heart, revealed to my face, I under- stood... ’’? He thus attributes the new faith to Re as its source, and claims to have been himself the channel of its revelation. He immediately assumed the office of High Priest of his new god with the same title, ‘‘Great Seer,’’ as that of the High Priest of Re at Heliopolis.* But, however evident the Heliopolitan origin of the new state religion might he, it was not merely sun-worship; the word Aton was employed in place of the old word for ‘‘god’’ (nuter),* and the god is clearly distinguished from the material sun.

C. which brought in the Phryg- ians (see p. 478). As shown on the Egyptian monuments, they are beardless, with long hair hanging in two prominent locks before their ears and dropping to the shoulders; but their own native monuments often give them a heavy beard (Wig. 146).

As their cli- mate demands, they wear heavy woollen clothing, usually in a long, close-fitting garment, depending from the shoulders and reaching to the knees or sometimes the ankles; while the feet are shod in high boots turned up at the toes. They possessed a crude, but by no means primitive, art which produced very creditable monuments in stone (Figs. 145-6) still scattered over the hills of Asia Minor. Their skill in the practical arts was considerable, and they produced a red figured pottery above mentioned which was disseminated in trade from the centre of its manufacture in Cappadocia to the Aigean on the west, and eastward through Syria and Palestine to Lachish and Gezer on the south. Already by 2000 B. C. we remember it had perhaps reached the latter place.

It is this aspect of Ikhnaton’s mind which is especially remarkable; he is the first prophet of history. While to the traditional Pharaoh the state god was only the triumphant conqueror, who crushed all peoples and drove them tribute-laden before the Pharaoh’s chariot, Ikhnaton saw in him the beneficent father of all men. It is the first time in history that a dis- cerning eye has caught this great universal truth. Again his whole movement was but a return to nature, resulting from a spontaneous recognition of the goodness and the beauty evident in it, mingled also with a consciousness of the mystery in it all, which adds just the fitting element of mysticism in such a faith. How manifold are all thy works! They are hidden from before us, O thou sole god, whose powers no other possesseth. While Ikhnaton thus recognized clearly the power, and to a surprising extent, the beneficence of God, there is not here a very spiritual conception of the deity nor any attribution to him of ethical qualities beyond those which Amon had long been supposed to possess. The king has not percep- tibly risen from the beneficence to the righteousness in the character of God, nor to his demand for this in the charac- ter of men. Nevertheless, there is in his ‘‘teaching,’’ as it is fragmentarily preserved in the hymns and tomb-inscrip- tions of his nobles, a constant emphasis upon ‘‘truth’’ such as is not found before nor since. The king always attaches to his name the phrase ‘‘living in truth,’’ and that this phrase was not meaningless is evident in his daily life. To him it meant an acceptance of the daily facts of living in a simple and unconventional manner. For him what was was right and its propriety was evident by its very exist- ence. Thus his family life was open and unconcealed be- fore the people. He took the greatest delight in his children and appeared with them and the queen, their mother, on all possible occasions, as if he had been but the humblest scribe in the Aton-temple. He had himself depicted on the monuments while enjoying the most familiar and unaffected 378 A HISTORY OF", "question": "How did Ikhnaton depict his personal and family life on monuments?", "answer": "Ikhnaton chose to depict himself on monuments enjoying familiar family moments with his children and queen, presenting his family life openly and unconcealed before the people."}

There could not but be, and, as the result shows, there was, during all of Ikhnaton’s reign a powerful priestly party which openly or secretly did all in its power to undermine him. The neglect and loss of the Asiatic empire must have turned against the king many a strong man, and aroused indigna- tion among those whose grandfathers had served under Thutmose III. The memory of what had been done in those glorious days must have been sufficiently strong to fire the hearts of the military class and set them looking for a leader who would recover what had been lost. Ikhnaton might appoint one of his favourites to the command of the army, as we have seen he did, but his ideal aims and his high motives for peace would be as unpopular as they were unin- telligible to his commanders. One such man, an officer named Harmhab,! was now in the service of Ikhnaton and enjoying the royal favour; he contrived not only to win the support of the military class, but, as we shall later see, he also gained the favour of the priests of Amon, who were of course looking for some one who could bring them the opportunity they coveted.

His name was now changed and the qualifying phrase at the end of it was altered from ‘‘ Heat which is in Aton’’ to ‘‘Fire which comes from Aton.’’ Meantime the national convul- sion which his revolution had precipitated was producing the most disastrous consequences throughout the land. The Aton-faith disregarded some of the most cherished beliefs of the people, especially those regarding the hereafter. Osiris, their old time protector and friend in the world of darkness, was taken from them and the magical parapher- nalia which were to protect them from a thousand foes were gone. Some of them tried to put Aton into their old usages, but he was not a folk-god, who lived out in yonder tree or spring, and he was too far from their homely round of daily needs to touch their lives. The people could understand nothing of the refinements involved in the new faith. They only knew that the worship of the old gods had been inter- dicted and a strange deity of whom they had no knowledge and could gain none was forced upon them. Such a decree of the state could have had no more effect upon their prac- tical worship in the end than did that of Theodosius when he banished the old gods of Egypt in favour of Christianity eighteen hundred years after Ikhnaton’s revolution.

Six months after the dating of this tablet the old king was already dead (1313 B. C.), and Seti, as sole king of Egypt, succeeded him.’ During his short coregency of not more than a year, Seti I must have already laid all his plans and organized his army in readiness for an attempt to recover the lost empire in Asia. The desert road leading to Palestine from Tharu, the frontier fort of Egypt, whither Harmhab’s noseless exiles were banished, was again put in condition. The for- tified stations which protected the wells and cisterns dis- tributed along it were rebuilt and repaired.” It was a march of ten days from Tharu through the desert to Gaza in southern Palestine,* and a plentiful supply of water was therefore absolutely essential throughout the march.

The next morning Ramses broke camp early, and putting himself at the head of the division of Amon, he left the other divisions to follow after, while he set out down the last slope of the high valley to the ford of the Orontes at Shabtuna, later known to the Hebrews as Ribleh. Here the river left the precipitous, canon-like valley in which it had hitherto flowed, and for the first time permitted a crossing to the west side on which Kadesh was, thus enabling an army approaching the city from the south to cut off a con- siderable bend in the river. Reaching the ford after a march of three hours at most and probably less, Ramses prepared for the crossing. Day after day his officers had reported to him their inability to find any trace of the enemy and had added their impression that he was still far in the north.

However this may be, we find him at Memphis in his third year consulting with his officials regarding the possibility of opening up the Wadi Alaki country in Nubia and developing there the mines which Seti I had unsuccessfully attempted to exploit.” The viceroy of Kush, who was present, explained the difficulty to the king and related the fruitless attempt of his father to supply the route with water. It was now so bad that when the caravaneers attempted the desert journey thither ‘it was only half of them that arrived there; for they died of thirst on the road, together with the asses which they drove before them.’’ They were obliged to take enough water for the round trip, as they could obtain none at the mines. ‘‘Hence no gold was brought from this country for 1]II, 274-7. 2JII, 251-281. 3III, 279-281. 4TII, 281, 1. 103, note. 5]II, 282-293. 422 A HISTORY OF EGYPT lack of water.’’' With subtle flattery the viceroy and court advised another attempt to supply the route with water,’ and the result of the ensuing royal command to undertake it was a letter from the viceroy of Kush announcing the complete success of the enterprise and the discovery of a copious spring of water at a depth of only twenty feet.’ At Kubban, where the road leading to the mines left the Nile-valley, Ramses had the viceroy erect a stela commem- orating the achievement and bearing a record of the events which we have sketched.* Such enterprises of internal ex- ploitation were but preparatory in the plans of Ramses. His ambition held him to greater purposes; and he contem- plated nothing less than the recovery of the great Asiatic empire, conquered by his predecessors of the EHighteenth Dynasty. 1 TIT, 286. 2 IIT, 288-9, 3 III, 292. ‘III, 282-295.

Anxious to reach Kadesh and begin the siege that day, the Pharaoh even drew away from the division of Amon and with no van before him, accompanied only by his household troops, was rapidly nearing Kadesh as midday approached. Meantime Metella, the Hittite king, had drawn up his troops in battle-array on the northwest of Kadesh, and Ramses, without hint of danger was ap- proaching the entire Hittite force, while the bulk of his army was scattered along the road some eight or ten miles in the rear, and the officers of Re and Ptah were relaxing in the shade of the neighbouring forests after the hot and dusty march. The crafty Metella, seeing that the story of his two Beduin, whom he had sent out for the very purpose 428 A HISTORY OF EGYPT of deceiving Ramses, had been implicitly accepted, fully appreciated how best to utilize the rare opportunity. He does not attack Ramses at once, but as the Pharaoh ap- proaches the city the Hittite quickly transfers his entire army to the east side of the river, and while Ramses passes northward along the west side of Kadesh, Metella deftly dodges him, moving southward along the east side of the city, always keeping it between him and the Egyptians to prevent his troops from being seen. As he draws in on the east and southeast of the city he has secured a position on Ramses flank which is of itself enough, if properly utilized, to ensure him an overwhelming victory, even involv- ing the destruction of Ramses and his army. The Egyptian forces were now roughly divided into two groups: near Kadesh were the two divisions of Amon and Re, while far southward the divisions of Ptah and Sutekh have not yet crossed at the ford of Shabtuna.

It was in that year, therefore, that Ramses pushed northward along the coast of Pheenicia to this point.1. Unfortunately for Ramses, this preparatory campaign, however necessary, gave the Hittite king, Metella, an opportunity to collect all his resources and to muster all available forces from every possible source. All the vassal kings of his great empire were compelled to contribute their levies to his army. We find among them the old enemies of Egypt in Syria: the kings of Naharin, Arvad, Carchemish, Kode, Kadesh, Nuges, Ekereth (Ugarit) and Aleppo. Besides these, Metella’s subject kingdoms in Asia Minor, like Kez- weden and Pedes, were drawn upon;? and not content with the army thus collected, he emptied his treasury to tempt the mercenaries of Asia Minor and the Mediterranean islands. Roving bands of Lycian sailors, such as had plundered the coasts of the Delta and of Cyprus in the Kighteenth Dynasty, besides Mysians, Cilicians, Dardanians, and levies of the unidentified Erwenet, took service in the Hittite ranks.2 In this manner Metella collected an army more formidable than any which Egypt had ever hitherto been called upon to meet. In numbers it was large for those times, containing probably not less than twenty thousand men. Ramses on his part had not been less active in securing mercenary support. From the remote days of the Old King- dom Nubian levies had been plentifully sprinkled through the Egyptian armies; one of their tribes, the Mazoi, fur- nished gensdarmes-police for Ikhnaton’s capital, and they were commonly found in similar service elsewhere in the Pharaoh’s realm. Among the troops used to garrison Syria in the days of the Amarna letters sixty years before we find the ‘‘Sherden,’’ or Sardinians, who there appear for the first time in history. These men were now taken into Ramses’ army in considerable numbers, so that they con- stituted a recognized element in it, and the king levied ‘‘his infantry, his chariotry and the Sherden.’’* Ramses claims to have taken them as prisoners in one of his victories,’ and 1 TIT, 297. 2 TIT, 306. 3 Ibid. ‘III, 307. 6 Ibid. *9SS pue Ezb dd vag *ynio qevau (19a 30d) q[ay YEN 24} Jo yINow ay} ye sO auo ayy ul UMOF ‘uIna Oleg ‘AUIU sTy WoOIy “VIO NI (L4q7 NO GNV (LHO Il SASN AO WIA 6ST ‘917 TI ILAS JO GVA “lg THE: WARS OF RAMSES II", "question": "Which mercenary groups were specifically mentioned as being part of Ramses II's army?", "answer": "Ramses II's army incorporated Nubian levies, especially from the Mazoi tribe, and Sherden (Sardinian) mercenaries, who formed a recognized element within his forces."}

Of these the most important were: the renunciation by both rulers of all projects of conquest against the other, the reaffirmation of the former treaties existing between the two countries, a defensive alliance involving the assistance of each against the other’s foes; cooperation in the chastise- ment of delinquent subjects, probably in Syria; and the extradition of political fugitives and immigrants.

{"context": "At this juncture an incident common in oriental warfare saved Ramses from total destruction. Had the mass of the Hittite chariotry swept in upon his rear from the west and south he must certainly have been lost. But to his great good fortune his camp had fallen into the hands of these troops and, dismounting from their chariots, they had thrown discipline to the winds as they gave thera- selves up to the rich plunder. Thus engaged, they were suddenly fallen upon by a body of Ramses’ recruits who may possibly have marched in from the coast to join his army at Kadesh. At any rate, they did not belong to either of the southern divisions. They completely surprised the plundering Asiatics in the camp and slew them to a man. The sudden offensive of Ramses along the river and the unexpected onslaught of the ‘‘reeruits’’ must have consider- ably dampened the ardour of the Hittite attack, giving the 432 A HISTORY OF EGYPT Pharaoh an opportunity to recover himself. These newly arrived ‘‘recruits,’’? together with the returning fugitives from the unharmed but scattered division of Amon, so aug- mented his power that there was now a prospect of his maintaining himself till the arrival of the division of Ptah. The stubborn defense which now followed forced the Hittite king to throw in his reserves of a thousand chariots. Six times the desperate Pharaoh charged into the replenished lines of the enemy, but for some reason Metella did not send against him the eight thousand foot which he had stationed on the east side of the river opposite Ramses’ position; and the struggle remained a battle of chariotry as long as we can trace it. For three long hours, by prodigies of personal valour, the Pharaoh kept his scanty forces together, throwing many an anxious glance southward toward the road from Shabtuna, along which the division of Ptah was toiling in response to his message. Finally, as the long afternoon wore on and the sun was low in the west, the stand- ards of Ptah glimmering through the dust and heat glad- dened the eyes of the weary Pharaoh. Caught between the opposing lines, the Hittite chariotry was driven into the city, probably with considerable loss; but our sources do not permit us to follow these closing incidents of the battle.

Recently a preliminary draught of the Hittite copy in cuneiform on a clay tablet, was found by Winckler at Boghaz-koi in Asia Minor. It will be noticed that the treaty nowhere refers to the boundary recognized by both countries in Syria; and we can only suppose that it may have been contained in one of the earlier treaties reaffirmed by it. It is difficult to determine the exact location of this boundary. The cuneiform docu- ments found by Winckler at Boghaz-k6i since 1906 (see p. 1TTI, 373. 2TII, 367-391. THE WARS OF RAMSES I1 439 381) show that the Hittite kings continued to control Amor on the upper Orontes. It is not safe to affirm that he had permanently advanced the boundary of his father’s king- dom in Asia, save probably on the coast, where he carved two more stele on the rocks near Berut, beside that of his fourth year, with which we are already acquainted.’ The Hittite king is recognized in the treaty as on an equality with the Pharaoh and receives the same conditions; but as commonly in the orient the whole transaction was inter- preted by Ramses on his monuments as a great triumph for himself, and he now constantly designated himself as the conqueror of the Hittites.2 Once consummated, the peace was kept, and although it involved the sacrifice of Ramses’ ambitions for conquest in Asia, the treaty must have been entirely satisfactory to both the parties. Thirteen years later (1259 B. C.) the Hittite king himself visited Egypt to consummate the marriage of his eldest daughter as the wife of Ramses. Bearing rich gifts in a brilliant proces- sion, with his daughter at its head, Khetasar, accompanied by the king of Kode, appeared in Ramses’ palace,® and his military escort mingled with the Egyptian troops whom they had once fought upon the Syrian plains.

His constant presence here resulted in a development of the cities of the eastern Delta such as they had never before enjoyed.

Hence it was that the High Priest of Amon under Merneptah (Ramses II’s son and suc- cessor) and possibly already under Ramses himself was able THE EMPIRE OF RAMSES II 457 to go further and to install his son as his own successor, thus firmly entrenching his family at the head of the most powerful hierarchy in Egypt.t. While such a family like a royal dynasty might suffer overthrow, the precedent was a dangerous one, and it ultimately resulted in the dethrone- ment of the Pharaohs at the hands of the priests. That event, however, was still some hundred and fifty years distant, and meantime the High Priest employed his power and influence with the Pharaoh in enforcing ever fresh demands upon his treasury, until before the close of the Nineteenth Dynasty Amon had even secured certain gold country in Nubia in his own right. It was administered by the viceroy of Kush, who therefore assumed the additional title ‘‘Governor of the Gold Country of Amon.’’? Thus there was gradually arising the sacerdotal state described by Diodorus, upon which the Egyptian priests of Greek times looked back as upon a golden age. As the inward content of the prevailing religion had already long been determined by the dominant priesthood, so now its outward manifes- tations were being elaborated by them into a vast and inflex- ible system, and the popularity of every Pharaoh with the priesthood was determined by the degree of his aquiescence in its demands. Though the state religion was made up of formalities, the Pharaohs were not without their own ethical standards, and these were not wholly a matter of appearances.

This last incident was not only influential in graphic art; it also wrought powerfully upon the imagination of the court poets, one of whom produced a prose poem on the battle, which displays a good deal of literary skill, and is the nearest approach to the epic to be found in Egyptian literature. We are told how the foe covered the hills like grass-hoppers, the incidents that led up to the catastrophe are narrated with precision and clearness, and then as the Pharaoh finds himself alone in the midst of the foe the poet pictures him calling upon his father Amon for aid while the god in distant Thebes, hearing the ery of his son, answers and nerves his arm for the ordeal in a response which has all the fine and heroic spirit of the epic poem. The author’s perception of dramatic contrasts is remarkable. He depicts the dismay of the royal charioteer that he may contrast it with Ramses’ undaunted spirit and may put into the Pharaoh’s mouth a fiery speech of encouragement. When it is all over and the crisis passed there is, among other incidents, a pleasing epic touch in Ramses’ vow that the brave chariot-horses which bore him safely through the conflict shall always be fed by his own hand. A copy of this composition on papyrus was made by a scribe named Pentewere (Pentaur), who was misunderstood by early stu- dents of the document to be the author of the poem. The real author is unknown, although ‘‘ Pentaur’’ still commonly enjoys the distinction.

In the tale, however, the Nineteenth Dynasty really showed great fertility, combined with a spontaneous natur- alism, which quite swept away all trace of the artificialities of the Middle Kingdom.

There were stately pageants when the magnificent Pharaoh, now in the prime of life, received the magnates of his empire, from the crown-princs down through all his exalted dignitaries to the mayors of the outlying towns, a brilliant procession, bringing him the tribute and impost of his realm from the southern limits of Nubia to the Hittite frontier in Syria.t| The wealth thus gained still served high purposes.

The young Pharaoh under whom these momentous transi- tions were slowly taking place was too plastic in dealing with them for us to discover the manner of man he was.

Ramses III inherited a situation precisely like that which confronted Merneptah at his accession; but being a young and vigourous man, he was better able suc- cessfully to cope with it. He immediately perfected the organization for military service, dividing all the people into classes successively liable for such service. A large proportion of the standing army, not exactly determinable, consisted of Sherden mercenaries, as in Ramses II’s day, while a contingent of the Kehek, a Libyan tribe, was also in the ranks.1. These mercenaries of course served as long as they were eligible. Since the native contingent was con- stantly shifting, as class after class passed through the army, the Pharaoh came more and more to depend upon the mercenaries as the permanent element in his army. The affairs of the newly organized government gave Ramses no opportunity to deal with the chronic situation in the western Delta until he was rudely awakened to the necessity for action, as Merneptah had been. But more serious develop- ments had taken place since the latter’s Libyan war. The restless and turbulent peoples of the northern Mediterranean, whom the Egyptians designated the ‘‘peoples of the sea,’’ were showing themselves in ever increasing numbers in the south.

Intercourse and commerce with the outside world were now fostered by the Pharaoh as in the great days of the Em- pire. The temples of Amon, Re and Ptah had each its own fleet upon the Mediterranean or the Red Sea, transporting to the god’s treasury the products of Phenicia, Syria and Punt.2. Ramses exploited the copper mines of Atika, a region somewhere in the Peninsula of Sinai, sending a spe- cial expedition thither in galleys from some Red Sea port. They returned with great quantities of the metal which the Pharaoh had displayed under the palace balcony that all the people might see it. To the malachite workings of the Pen- insula he likewise sent his messengers, who brought back plentiful returns of the costly mineral for the king’s splendid gifts to the gods. A more important expedition consisting of a fleet of large ships was sent on the long voyage to Punt. The canal from the Nile through the Wadi Tumilat to the Red Sea, existent long before this age (see p. 188), was now seemingly stopped up and in disuse, for Ramses’ ships, 1JV, 410, 21V, 211, 270, 328, STV, 408, 4IV, 409. 486 A TMSTORY (OF HGY PT after a successful voyage, returned to some harbour opposite Coptos, where the entire cargo of the fleet was disembarked, loaded on donkeys and brought overland to Coptos.

He fortified his Syrian frontier and rapidly gathered a fleet, which he dis- tributed in the northern harbours.1 From his palace bal- cony he personally superintended the equipment of the infantry,? and when all was in readiness he set out for Syria to lead the campaign himself. Where the land-battle took place we are unable to determine, but as the North- erners had advanced to Amor, it was at most not further north than that region. We learn nothing from Ramses III’s records concerning it beyond vague and general state- ments of the defeat of the enemy, although in his reliefs we see his Sherden mercenaries breaking through the scat- tered lines of the enemy and plundering their ox-carts, bear- ing the women and children and the belongings of the North- erners. As there were Sherden among the invaders, Ramses III’s mercenaries were thus called upon to fight their own countrymen. Ramses was also able to reach the scene of the naval battle, probably in one of the northern harbours on the coast of Phenicia, early enough to participate in the action from the neighbouring shore. He had manned his fleet with masses of the dreaded Egyptian archers, whose fire was so effective that the ranks of the heavy armed North- erners were completely decimated before they could ap- proach within boarding distance. This fire was augmented and rendered still more effective by bodies of Egyptian archers whom Ramses stationed along the shore, he himself personally drawing his bow against the hostile fleet. As the Egyptians then advanced to board, the enemy’s ships were thrown into confusion (Fig. 173).", "question": "Which specific groups made up the main support of the invading \"peoples of the sea\"?", "answer": "The main support for the \"peoples of the sea\" consisted of Peleset, Thekel, Shekelesh, Denyen, and Weshesh."}

To supply the demand the papyrus factories of the Delta were exporting their products in exchange for Phenician commod- ities.” It was of course impracticable, if not impossible, for the Phenicians to keep rapid daily records on paper with pen and ink in the cuneiform hand which was totally unsuited to such writing materials. With the papyrus paper, there- fore, the hand customarily written upon it in Hgypt now made its way into Phenicia, where before the tenth cen- tury B. C. it developed into an alphabet of consonants, which was quickly transmitted to the Ionian Greeks and thence to Europe. | The chief function of an oriental despotism, the collec- tion of tribute and taxes, now proceeded with the greatest regularity. ‘‘I taxed them for their impost every year,’’ says Ramses, ‘‘every town by its name gathered together bearing their tribute.’’® The suppression of occasional dis- orders in Nubia’ caused no disturbance of the profound peace which now settled down upon the Empire.

The temples were fast becoming a grave political and economic menace. 490 A HISTORY OF EGYPT In the face of this fact Ramses III continued the policy of his ancestors, and with the most lavish liberality poured the wealth of the royal house into the sacred coffers. He himself says: ‘‘I did mighty deeds and benefactions, a nu- merous multitude, for the gods and goddesses of South and North. I wrought upon their images in the gold-houses, I built that which had fallen to ruin in their temples. I made houses and temples in their courts; I planted for them groves; I dug for them lakes; I founded for them divine offerings of barley and wheat, wine, incense, fruit, cattle and fowl; I built the [chapels called] ‘Shadows of Re’ for their districts, abiding, with divine offerings for every day.’’! He is here speaking of the smaller temples of the: country, while for the three great gods of the land: Amon, Re and Ptah, he did vastly more. The opulent splendour with which the rituals of these gods were daily observed beggars description. ‘‘I made for thee,’’ says Ramses to Amon, ‘‘a great sacrificial tablet of silver in hammered work, mounted with fine gold, the inlay figures being of Ketem-gold, bearing statues of the king of gold in ham- mered work, even an offering tablet bearing thy divine offerings, offered before thee. I made for thee a great vase-stand for thy forecourt, mounted with fine gold, with inlay of stone; its vases were of gold, containing wine and beer in order to present them to thee every morning... .

I made for thee other tablets of silver, in beaten work, engraved with the great name of thy majesty, with the decrees of thy house.’’? All that the god used was of the same richness;?

As we know nothing of the size and value of these towns, the number is hardly significant in view of the immense superiority of Amon in acreage of temple lands.

The reader may peruse pages of such descrip- tions in the great Papyrus Harris,* of which we shall later give some account. Such magnificence, while it might fre- quently be due to incidental gifts of the king, must never- theless be supported by an enormous income, derived from a vast fortune in lands, slaves and revenues. ‘Thus, to the god Khnum at Elephantine, Ramses III confirmed the possession of both sides of the river from that city to Takompso, a strip over seventy miles in length, known to the Greeks as the Dodekaschoinos or Twelve Scheni.* The records of Ramses III for the first and only time in the course of Egyptian history, enable us to determine the total amount of property owned and controlled by the temples. An inventory in the Papyrus Harris covering almost all the temples of the country shows that they pos- sessed over one hundred and seven thousand slaves;° that 1s, one person in every fifty to eighty of the population was temple property. ‘The first figure is the more probable, so that in all likelihood one person in every fifty was a slave of some temple. The temples thus owned two percent of the pop- ulation.

In the early orient there is always among the many mothers of the king’s children a princess or queen who feels that her son has a better claim to the succession than the son of the fortunate rival, who has succeeded in gaining for him the nomination as the king’s successor. Such a queen in Ramses III’s harem, named Tiy, now began furtive efforts to secure for her son, Pentewere, the crown, which had been promised to another prince.* <A plot against the old king’s life was rap- idly formed, and Tiy enlisted as her chief coadjutors the ‘‘chief of the chamber,’’ Pebekkamen, and a royal butler named Mesedsure. With oriental superstition, Pebekkamen first procured an outfit of magical waxen figures of gods and men, by which he believed he was empowered to dis- - able or evade the people of the harem guard, who might otherwise have discovered and intercepted one of their numerous messages necessary to the development of the plot. Pebekkamen and Mesedsure then secured the coop- eration of ten harem officials of various ranks, four royal butlers, an overseer of the treasury, a general in the army named Peyes, three royal scribes in various offices, Pebek- kamen’s own assistant, and several subordinate officials.

The old Pharaoh, sorely shaken by the ordeal, and possibly suffering bodily injury from the attempted assassination, immediately appointed a special court for the trial of the conspirators. The very words of the commission empowering this court indicate his probable consciousness that he would not long survive the shock, while at the same time they lay upon the judges a responsibility for impartial justice on the merits of the case, with a judicial objectivity which is remarkable in one who held the lives of the accused in his unchallenged power and had himself just been the victim of a murderous assault at their hands.

At this point his report breaks off, and the conclusion is lost; but here again, in Cyprus, whose king, as practically his vassal, the Pharaoh had been wont to call to account for piracy in the old days of splendour, we find the representative of Egypt barely able to save his life. It is to be noticed that his reminder of unpleasant consequences makes no reference to the Pharaoh, while it places fully as much emphasis upon the vengeance of the prince of Byblos as upon that of Egypt; this only two generations after a great war-fleet of Ramses III had de- stroyed the powerful united navy of his northern enemies in these very waters. This unique and instructive report of Wenamon,' therefore, reveals to us the complete collapse of Egyptian prestige abroad and shows with what appalling swiftness the dominant state in the Mediterranean basin had declined under the weak successors of Ramses III. When Tiglath-pileser I appeared in the West about 1100 B. C., a Pharaoh, who was probably Nesubenebded, feeling his ex- posed position in the Delta, deemed it wise to propitiate the Assyrian with a gift, and sent him a crocodile.

C.), or about that time, a body of Egyptian envoys were detained at Byblos by the local dynast for seventeen years, and unable to return, they at last died there.2 The Syrian princes, among whom Ramses III had built a temple to Amon, to which they brought their yearly tribute, were thus indifferent to the power of Egypt within twenty or twenty five years of his death. 1TV, 558. 2 Jer. 47: 4; Amos 9: 7. 3TV, 585. THE FALL OF THE EMPIRE 513 A few years later, under Ramses XII, these same condi- tions in Syria are vividly portrayed in the report of an Egyptian envoy thither. In response to an oracle, Wena- mon, the envoy in question, was dispatched to Byblos, at the foot of Lebanon, to procure cedar for the sacred barge of Amon. Hrihor, the High Priest of Amon, was able to give him only a pitiful sum in gold and silver, and there- fore sent with him an image of Amon, called ‘‘ Amon-of-the- Way,’’ who was able to bestow ‘‘life and health,’’ hoping thus to impress the prince of Byblos and compensate for the lack of liberal payment. As Wenamon was obliged to pass through the territory of Nesubenebded, who now ruled the Delta, Hrihor supplied him with letters to the Delta prince, and in this way secured for him passage in a ship com- manded by a Syrian captain. Nothing more eloquently por- trays the decadent condition of Egypt than the humiliating state of this unhappy envoy, dispatched without ships, with no credentials, with but a beggarly pittance to offer for the timber desired, and only the memory of Egypt’s former greatness with which to impress the prince of Byblos.

The city itself at least was not taxable by the Pharaoh, and was never visited by his fiscal officials. Under these circumstances an outbreak among the Libyan lords of the Delta or in the powerful principalities of the South might be expected as soon as there was no longer over them a strong hand like that of Sheshonk I. - Under the energetic Sheshonk Egypt’s foreign policy took on a more aggressive character, and her long merely formal claims upon Palestine were practically pressed. Solomon was evidently an Egyptian vassal who possibly received in marriage a daughter of the Pharaoh and whose territory his Egyptian suzerain extended by the gift of the important city of Gezer.* We last heard of it under Mer- neptah three hundred years before; but never having been subdued by the Israelites, its Canaanite lord had now re- belled. The Pharaoh captured and burned it and presented it to Solomon, who rebuilt it.25 The Pharaoh with whom Solomon had to deal, a Pharaoh who captured and burned strong cities in Palestine like Gezer, cannot have been one of the degenerate kings at the close of the Twenty First Dy- nasty, but an aggressive ruler who resumed Egypt’s con- trol in Palestine; and we know of no other king at this time who answers this description save Sheshonk I.

The High Priest’s methods and theory of government were not calculated to compel the respect of the Syrians. The state which he founded was a theocracy, pure and simple. As far back as the days of Thutmose II] and Hatshepsut there are remarkable examples of Amon’s intervention in the affairs of practical government.

Under Hrihor’s theocracy such oracles became part of the ordinary machinery of govern- ment. Whatever the High Priest wished legally to effect could be sanctioned by special oracle of the god at any time, and by prearrangement the cultus image before which the High Priest made known his desires invariably responded favourably by violent nodding of the head, or even by speech. All wills and property conveyances of members of the High Priest’s family were oracles of Amon,! and civil documents thus became divine decrees. Banished political exiles were recalled by oracle of the god, criminal cases were tried before him, and by his decision the convicted were put to death. In the case of a temple official, undoubtedly a favourite of the High Priest, two documents were placed before the god, one declaring the accused guilty of embez- zlement of temple income, and the other declaring him inno- cent.

Under cover of night Tefnakhte succeeded in entering the city and exhorted the garrison to rely on their strong walls, their plentiful supplies and the high water, which pro- tected the east side from attack, urging them to hold out while he rode away northward for reinforcements. Having landed on the north of the city, Piankhi was surprised at the strength of the place. Some of his people favoured a siege, others desired to storm the walls upon embankments and causeways to be raised for the purpose. Piankhi him- self decided to assault, but rejecting labourious works, which besides being too slow would give the enemy exact indication of the place of attack, he devised a shrewd plan of assault, ATV, 850. ETHIOPIAN SUPREMACY: TRIUMPH OF ASSYRIA 548 which speaks highly for his skill as a strategist. The high walls on the west of the city had been recently raised still higher, and it was evident that the east side, protected by waters perhaps artificially raised, was being neglected. Here was the harbour, where the ships now floated so high that their bow ropes were fastened among the houses of the city. Piankhi sent his fleet against the harbour and quickly cap- tured all the shipping. Then taking command in person, he rapidly ranged the captured craft together with his own fleet along the eastern walls, thus furnishing footing for his assaulting lines, which he immediately sent over the ram- parts and captured the city before its eastern defenses could be strengthened against him.", "question": "What strategic method did Piankhi employ to successfully capture the heavily fortified city of Memphis?", "answer": "Piankhi devised a shrewd plan to assault Memphis from the east.

The wily Piankhi, perceiving that the balance of power in the North was now destroyed, and desirous of drawing his enemy further southward, away from the safety of the impenetrable Delta swamps, quietly awaited developments. A second appeal from his northern commanders then informed him that Namlot, king of Her- mopolis, had submitted to Tefnakhte. Thereupon Piankhi sent his commanders in Kgypt northward to check Tef- nakhte’s further southern advance and to besiege Hermop- olis. This they did while Piankhi was at the same time dispatching from Nubia a second army for their support. Having left Thebes, this second Nubian force met Tef- nakhte’s fleet coming up and defeated it, capturing many ships and prisoners. Continuing northward, in all proba- bility down the Bahr Yusuf, they struck Tefnakhte’s forces engaged in the investment of Heracleopolis, and put it to flight both by land and water. The northerners fled to the west side of the Bahr Yusuf, whither they were pursued the next morning by the Nubians, again discomfited and forced to retreat toward the Delta. Namlot, king of Hermopolis, who had fought among Tefnakhte’s vassals, escaped from 1 From here on, after the Piankhi Stela (IV, 796-883).

Hearing of this, the Nubian commanders returned up the Bahr Yusuf to Hermopolis, which they then closely beset. On receiving reports of these operations, Piankhi was incensed that the northern army had been allowed to escape into the Delta. It was now late in the calendar year, and Piankhi determined, after the celebration of the New Year’s feast at home, to proceed to Thebes to celebrate there the great feast of Opet in the third month, and then to lead the campaign against the North in person. Meanwhile his com- manders in Egypt captured the towns below and in the vicin- ity of Hermopolis, including the important Oxyrhyncus, but Hermopolis itself still held out against them.

Piankhi vigourously pushed the siege; from embankments and high towers the doomed city was daily showered with ar- rows and stones; foul odours arose from the masses of dead, and not long after Piankhi’s arrival the place was ripe for surrender. Namlot, its king, finding that gifts, even when his own royal crown was cast down among them, availed nothing with Piankhi, sent out his queen to plead with the women of the Nubian that they might intercedewith him on Namlot’s behalf. This device was successful, and assured at last of his life, Namlot surrendered and turned over the eity and all his wealth to Piankhi, who immediately took possession of the place. After an inspection of Namlot’s palace and treasury, Piankhi entered the stables of the Her- mopolitan: ‘‘His majesty proceeded to the stable of the horses,’’ so say his annals, ‘‘and the quarters of the foals. When he saw that they had suffered hunger, he said: ‘I swear as Re loves me . . . it is more grievous in my heart that my horses have suffered hunger than any evil deed that 542 A HISTORY OF EGYPT thou hast done in the prosecution of thy desire.’ ’’?! Nam- lot’s wealth was then assigned to the royal treasury of Piankhi and the sacred fortune of Amon. Heracleopolis being already exhausted after its jawaees ment at the hands of Tefnakhte, its king, Pefnefdibast, now came to greet Piankhi and praise him for his deliver- ance. The advance to the Delta, sailing down the Bahr Yusuf, was then begun, and all the chief towns of the west side surrendered one after another on seeing Piankhi’s force except Crocodilopolis in the Fayum, which would have ear- ried him too far from his course past Illahun at the mouth of the Fayum.

He eventually succeeded in establishing a king- dom of Lower Egypt, assumed the Pharaonic titles and ruled at least eight years over a feudal state like that of the Twenty Second Dynasty. His reign is parallel with the last years of the Twenty Third Dynasty, which seems to have struggled on at Bubastis as vassal princes under him. It is evident that Tefnakhte was of a type far superior to the ordinary Delta dynast; he must have greatly increased the power and prestige of Sais, for his son Bocchoris, on succeeding to his father’s throne, was later regarded as the founder of the Twenty Fourth Dynasty. In Upper Egypt Piankhi’s rule continued for a brief period. He con- trolled Thebes long enough to do some slight building in the temple of Mut, where he left a relief representing a festal voyage of his ships, perhaps his return from the North; for among the vessels appears the state barge of Sais, captured from Tefnakhte’s fleet in the northern war. Piankhi was then still in control as far north as Heracle- opolis, whose commandant appears in the relief as admiral of the Nubian fleet.1_ In order to gain control of the fortune of Amon with an appearance of legitimacy, Piankhi caused his sister-wife, Amenardis, to be adopted by Shepnupet, the daughter of Osorkon III, who was sacerdotal princess of Thebes.?, The device was probably not new. But as Piankhi withdrew the decadent Twenty Third Dynasty put forth its last expiring effort and established an ephemeral au- thority in Thebes, where Osorkon III seems to have ruled for a short time as coregent with an otherwise unknown Takelot, the third of the name. Piankhi’s invasion of Egypt and entire reign there seem therefore to have fallen within the reign of Osorkon III. But the rising power of Sais soon overwhelmed the failing Bubastites, and, as we have noted, Bocchoris, son of Tefnakhte of Sais, gained the throne of Lower Egypt probably about 718 B. C. to be later known as the founder, and in so far as we know, the sole king of the Twenty Fourth Dynasty. We know nothing from the iTV, 811. IV, 940.

Re- membering the ancient supremacy of Egypt, failing to un- derstand the state of decadent impotence into which she had fallen, and anxious to shake off the oppressive Assyrian yoke, they lent a ready ear to the emissaries of Shabaka. Only in Judah did the prophet-statesman Isaiah foresee the futility of depending upon Egypt, and the final catastrophe which should overtake her at the hands of Assyria. The vigilant Assyrian, however, hearing of the projected alli- ance, acted so quickly that the conspirators were glad to drop their designs and protest fidelity. In spite of diffi- culties in Babylon and rebellions in the north, the able and aggressive Sargon pushed the consolidation of his power with brilliant success and left to his son Sennacherib in 705 B. C. the first stable and firmly compacted empire ever founded by a Semitic power. Sennacherib was embarrassed in his earlier years with the usual complications in Babylon.

As the western vassals remained quiet and Sennacherib was now absorbed in his operations at the other extremity of his empire, Shabataka was unmolested by the Assyrian. His name is rare in Egypt, but it is evident from the conditions which survived him that he was entirely unable to exterminate the local dynasts and consolidate the power of Egypt for the supreme struggle which was before her. It was indeed now patent that the Ethiopians were quite unfitted for the imperial task before them. The southern strain with which their blood was tinctured began to appear as the reign of Shabataka drew to a close about 688 B. C.

He was the son of a Nubian woman and his features, as preserved in contemporary sculptures, show unmistakable negroid characteristics. A son of the great Piankhi, he played a prominent role, and as we have seen, he was entrusted with the command of the army in the campaign against Sennacherib.

As a concession to this class his body-guard contained a thousand men from each of the two classes, the Hermotybies and Calasyries; but he will have had many more of his hardy Greeks and Carians at his hand on all occasions. The prosperous and powerful Egypt which was now emerging from the long Decadence was totally different from the Egypt of any earlier renascence. It was impos- sible again to rouse the nation to arms as in the days when the Hyksos were expelled; it was therefore inevitably the deliberate policy of Psamtik I, while expending every effort to put the nation on a sound economic basis, at the same time to depend upon foreign soldiery for the military power indispensable to an oriental ruler. His necessarily con- stant care was to transmute the economic prosperity of the land into military power. In a word, the wealth of the land must nourish and maintain a formidable army, even though the effective portion of this army might be aliens. This was an evil which Psamtik was powerless to alter. In such a state the conservation of the productive capacities of the 570 ANEHISTORY) OF EGYPT nation is as important as, or we may better say, indispen- sable to, tae maintenance of the army. Neither can live without the other. In this respect Psamtik I was confronted by the same problem which faced Omar and the early Ca: liphs. A revival under such conditions as these is due al- most solely to the personal initiative of the sovereign who manipulates the available forces: those of power and those of industry; so employing them all in harmonious interac- tion that prosperity and effective power result. Psamtik was himself the motive and creative power, while the people were but given the opportunity to fulfil their proper func- tions and to move freely in their wonted channels. There was no longer any great relative vitality in the nation (and here Psamtik’s task differed strikingly from that of the early Caliphs), and the return of ordered government and consequent prosperity enabled them to indulge the ten- dency to retrospect already observable in the Twenty Third Dynasty.

This remarkable achievement of Psamtik I places him among the ablest rulers who ever sat on the throne of the Pharaohs. Indeed the conditions by which he was confronted were so ad- verse, and the evils with which he was obliged to cope were so old, persistent and deeply rooted that his success should perhaps rank him higher than either Amenemhet I, the founder of the Twelfth Dynasty, or Ahmose I, the con- queror of the Hyksos.

Enjoy- ing certain privileges, some of the old dynasts therefore still survived, but the strong and skilful hand of Psamtik held them firmly in check, as in the days of the early Middle Kingdom under Amenemhet I.

He therefore revived the old connections with Syria; Phenician galleys filled the Nile mouths, and Semitic merchants, forerunners of the Ara- mans so numerous in Persian times, thronged the Delta. If Psamtik was able to employ the Greeks in his army he found them not less useful in the furtherance of his com- mercial projects. From the eighth century B. C. those southern movements of the northerners, of which the incur- sions of the ‘‘sea-peoples’’ over five hundred years earlier’ were the premonitory symptom, had now become daily occurrences. The Greeks, pushing in from the far North, and emerging clearly for the first time into history, had long since gained possessionof the Greek peninsula and its adjacent archipelago, with their centres of Mycenean civi- lization, and they now appeared as prosperous communities and rapidly growing maritime states, whose fleets, pene- trating throughout the Mediterranean, offered the Pheeni- cians sharp and incessant competition. Their colonies and industrial settlements, with active manufactories, rapidly fringed the Mediterranean and penetrated the Black Sea. Psamtik was probably the first of the Egyptian rulers who favoured such colonies in Egypt. Hre long the country was filled with Greek merchants, and their manufacturing settlements were permitted, especially in the western Delta, near the royal residence at Sais. There was a Greek and also a", "question": "How did Psamtik I's foreign policy differ from the internal characteristics of the Saitic period?", "answer": "In sharp contrast to the attempted internal restoration and national exclusiveness, Psamtik I's foreign policy showed little consideration for the past, focusing on economic value from foreign traffic."}
{"context": "I refer to the artistic capacity of the people. This always fruitful element of their culture was now a marked exception to the lifeless lack of initiative displayed in all other functions of life. Here their creative vitality, already revived in the Ethiopian period, was still unblighted and their artistic sense was keenly alive to the new possi- bilities open to them under the new order. We have seen that the Restoration in religion demanded the revival of the old subjects in the tomb-chapel reliefs, and in spite of the likeness of these copies to their ancient models, more than a superficial examination invariably discloses a dis- tinct character and manner peculiarly their own. There is . just that touch of freedom which the art of the Old King- dom lacked, and a soft beauty in their sinuous and sweeping lines which adds an indescribable grace to the reliefs of the Saitie school. If this tendency be sometimes extreme to the point of effeminacy, it is compensated for by the quali- ties which the new freedom brought with it. While the old canons and conventionalities still prevailed in general, there was now and then an artist who could shake them off and place the human body in relief with the shoulders drawn in proper relations and freed from the distortion of the Old Kingdom. It was this freedom and ability to see things as they are which led to a school of portraiture far surpassing the best work of the Old Kingdom. Among the Saitic mor- tuary reliefs the conventional heads prescribed by the Old Kingdom canons are still almost invariable; but the artist could now and then insert a portrait of such marked indi- viduality as to stand out in sharp contrast with the uni- formity of the neighbouring heads. Portraits of the same THE RESTORATION 573 character appear also in the round (ig. 186), displaying a study of the bony conformation of the skull, the folds and wrinkles of the skin, in fine a mastery of the entire anatomical development and a grasp of individual character such as no early art had yet achieved. Such works can only be com- pared with the portraits of the Greek sculptors at the height of their skill, and they do not suffer by the comparison. The artist in bronze was now supreme, hollow casts of consider- able size were made and animal forms are especially fine (Fig. 185). Superb bronze statues elaborately inlaid with rich designs in gold, silver and electrum display surprising refinements in technique.", "question": "What form of metal artistry became supreme during the Saitic period, and what were its characteristics?", "answer": "The artist in bronze was supreme, creating hollow casts of considerable size, especially fine animal forms, and superb bronze statues elaborately inlaid with gold, silver, and electrum."}

It is probable that the priests read into all these outward manifestations, as into their mythological tales, a higher meaning, which they never originally possessed. Of this pro- cedure we have already seen an example in the Empire,! but we are unable to determine whether they actually taught all that the Greeks attribute to them of this charac- ter. While their education in the Empire had kept them in contact with the living times, they were now obliged to learn a language and a method of writing, and to acquaint themselves with a mass of inherited literature, with which the busy world around them had long parted company. It was by this process that the ancient writing, already early regarded as of divine origin, became a sacred accomplish- ment, the especial characteristic of sacred learning, and was therefore called by the Greeks ‘‘hieroglyphs’’ or sacred glyphs. Such an education necessarily projected the priests far into a long forgotten world, whose inherited wisdom, as among the Chinese or the Mohammedans, was the final word. The writings and sacred rolls of the past were now eagerly sought out, and with the dust of ages upon them, they were collected, sorted and arranged. ‘Thus the past was supreme; the priest who cherished it lived in a realm of shadows, and for the contemporary world he had no vital meaning. Laike- wise in Babylon the same retrospective spirit was now the dominant characteristic of the reviving empire of Nebuchad- rezzar. The world was already growing old, and every- where men were fondly dwelling on her faraway youth. While the internal aspects of the Saitic period are so largely retrospective that it has been well called the Resto- ration, yet its foreign policy shows little consideration for the past. In sharp contrast with the attempted restoration and especially with the national exclusiveness, now more intense than ever, was the foreign policy of Psamtik I.

{"context": "They may have retained their lands, but judging from the case of Mentemhet of Thebes, they could not bequeath them to their sons. With these exceptions all the land belonged to the crown and was worked by the peasant serfs, who rendered twenty percent of the yield to the Pharaoh. Priests and soldiers were exempt from taxation. The administration must have been conducted as under the Empire by local officials of the cen- tral government, who collected the taxes and possessed judicial powers. The archaic titles which they bear, as far as I have been able to trace them, usually correspond to no real functions in government. In education and training these men are fundamentally different from the scribal officials of the Empire, in that they are not of necessity pos- sessed of a knowledge of the old hieroglyphic. Since the Ethiopian Dynasty there has grown up a very cursive form of hieratic, the ancient running hand. This new and more rapid form, an unconscious development, is better suited to the needs of practical business and administration, and being in common and everyday use, was therefore known to the Greeks as ‘‘demotic’’ writing, a term now usually applied to it at the present day. It represented the lan- guage then spoken, while the hieroglyphic of the time, which continued to lead an artificial existence, employed the archaic form of the language which had prevailed centuries before. That this fundamental change was but one among many modifications and alterations in the government, must of necessity have resulted from the changed conditions. So- cially, the influence of revived industry had divided the people into more or less sharply defined classes or guilds, de- termined by their occupations; but ‘‘caste’’ in the proper significance of the term, was as unknown as at any time in Egyptian history. The priests succeeded little better than the officials in their revival of the good old times. It is, indeed, to the priesthoods in general that the attempted restoration must be largely attributed. The religious, like the political, THE RESTORATION 575 centre, had completely shifted; Thebes, as we have stated, no longer possessed any religious significance. In the Delta cities of Sais, Athribis and Buto were the wealthiest temples. Quite in contrast with conditions in the Old Kingdom, the priests now constituted a more exclusive and distinct class than ever before, and the office had become inalienably hered- itary.", "question": "Where did the religious center of Egypt shift to during the Saitic restoration?", "answer": "The religious center shifted to the Delta cities of Sais, Athribis, and Buto."}

Tyre and Sidon, Moab and Ammon had also sent their emissaries to the Judean king, and when the weighty influence of Apries also fell into the scales the vacillating Zedekiah was no longer able to withstand, and he half-heartedly joined the rest in casting off the sovereignty of Babylon. The events for- merly following similar revolts from Assyrian authority were now reénacted under the Babylonians; the allies were unable to act quickly in concert. Indeed Apries made it 1m- possible that they should do so by attacking Tyre and Sidon. He dispatched an expedition to attempt the conquest of the north by sea, perhaps hoping to meet Nebuchadrezzar on the Euphrates as his grandfather Necho had done. He fought a victorious naval engagement with the Tyrians and Cyprians and landed enough troops to take Sidon, where- upon the other Pheenician cities yielded.* It is possible iTV, 988 A-988 J. 2TI Kings 24: 15. 3 Dicdorus, I, 68.

But it was never pushed far enough to accomplish anything inland; and Nebuchadrezzar wisely fixed his base of operations well northward, at Ribleh on the Orontes, where he was able to contemplate the Egyptian operations without concern. His enemies were exhausting themselves against each other, and had Apries advanced inland Nebu- chadrezzar could have quickly confronted him with a force from Ribleh.

In any case, he did not achieve the conquest of the country; and Jeremiah’ and Ezekiel,?, who were awaiting with feverish longing the complete overthrow of the hated Pharaoh’s kingdom, must have been sorely disap- pointed that the catastrophe which they had confidently pre- dicted to their countrymen failed to occur. As a result of the campaign, however, Amasis was obliged to renounce any ambitions which he may have cherished for the conquest of Syria-Palestine. His strong navy, nevertheless, enabled him completely to subdue Cyprus, which he organized as an Egyptian dependency, paying tribute to him. His naval strength, which now became formidable, was the foundation of the sea-power, which, under the Ptolemies, made Egypt the dominant state on the Mediterranean. Meanwhile Nebuchadrezzar had died (562 B. C.), and the disappearance of his powerful personality distinctly dimin- ished the prestige of the Babylonian Empire. As internal dissensions arose, the alliance with the Medes was no longer possible, and when finally Cyrus of Anshan, a Persian, suc- ceeded in supplanting the Median dynasty by the overthrow of the Median king, Astyages (550 B. C.), the position of Babylon was critical in the extreme. The extraordinary career of Cyrus was now a spectacle upon which all eyes in the west were fastened with wonder and alarm. Amasis was fully alive to the new danger which threatened his king- dom in common with all the other powers of the West. He therefore in 547 B. C. made common cause with them, form- ing a league with Croesus of Lydia, and the Spartans in the west; and in the east with Nabuna’id of Babylon. Before the allies could move together, Croesus was defeated and dethroned (546-5 B.

A navy such as Egypt now possessed,aid the large body of mercenaries in his army, drew heavily upon the treasury of Amasis; and his curtailment of the temple incomes was _ inevitable. It was the beginning of still more serious inroads upon the temple-estates in the Persian period, resulting under the Ptolemies in great reduction of the priestly rev- enues and the taxation of the temple-property. Politically impotent, the priesthoods could only swallow their discon- tent, which, however, gradually permeated all the upper classes.

His usurpation of the crown had furnished Nebuchadrezzar with the coveted opportu- nity of humiliating Egypt, which the Kaldean naturally supposed would have been weakened by the internal dissen- sions incident to such a revolution. Already before the death of Apries in 568 B. C., the army of the Kaldeans appeared on the Delta frontier, but the course of the subse- quent operations is unknown. It is not probable that Ne- buchadrezzar purposed the conquest of Egypt, which was now in a condition very different from the state of impotent 1 Revillout, Revue égyptologique, I, 59 ff., III, 105. 2Steindorff, Berichte der phil.-hist.

Climatic factor: • Egypt has a warm, sunny climate with very little rainfall that has led to the preservation of its ancient buildings. • Since sufficient light reached the interiors through doors & roof slits, Egyptian architecture is characterized by the absence of windows. • The massive walls, without openings, protected the interior from the fierce desert sun . • The absence of rain also resulted (the use of flat roof with thick stone slabs). • The Nile River flooded the fields every year at the same time, after harvesting season, and when it receded, it left behind fine silt – Cultivation by farmers. • Egyptians depended on annual floods to soak the land and deposit layer of rich soil. • Egyptians had to cooperate and control the Nile, Irrigation canals were dug from the river to the fields as well , Dikes were built on the sides of the Nile to protect villages and farmland from over- flooding . • Papyrus plants that grew on the coast were used to make sails, ropes, and paper • They were also hunters and fishermen. 8 • Egyptian religion had many gods representing the sun, moon, stars & animals. • The keynote of the Egyptian religion is the submission to the power of (Ammon) the sun God, & the worship of (Osiris) God of Death “the man-god who died & rose again to eternal life” , also ( Hator ) Goddess of love , (Anubis) God of mummification. • The power and greatness of these gods appeared in temples witch erected to them. • The most important phenomenon in their religious beliefs are the return of the soul after death (life after death),", "question": "What materials were primarily used for Egyptian palaces and houses versus tombs, pyramids, and temples?", "answer": "Sun-dried bricks made from Nile mud and chopped straw were used for palaces and houses, while stone was used for tombs, pyramids, and temples."}

It emerged, like so many other independent kingdoms, from the ruins of warring and fragmented fiefdoms and grew into a nation that shook North Africa and the surrounding world to its core. It became an epicentre for culture and religion, where science and magic were intertwined as one. But those golden ages, those heights of human achievement that challenged even those of Greece and Rome at their peaks, were not achieved in a day. Before the Assyrians came, before the Persians invaded, before the Greeks conquered and the Romans annexed, the Egyptians rose and fell all by themselves. While darker periods would form between them (three in fact, known as the Intermediate Periods), the timeline of Ancient Egypt has been defined by three distinct eras: the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom. A time of cultural rebirth and monumental construction, it was during the Old Kingdom that iconic structures that have endured millennia were built. The Middle Kingdom was when a nation was unified and forged anew. Then the realm was aggressively expanded and culture fostered like never before in the New Kingdom.

The Egyptians invented early forms of cosmetics, including eye makeup; they were one of the first civilisations (alongside Mesopotamia) to evolve a robust written language; they created papyrus thousands of years before the Chinese produced paper; they designed the basic calendar structure that we still use today; they can even lay claim to inventing bowling and early forms of breath mints.

The new king began fortifying the country’s borders, especially those between Egypt and Asia, where he erected the Walls of the Ruler in the East Delta. In fact, Amenemhat I rebuilt or built new fortifications all around Egypt, transforming military strategy from expansion to simple defence. Amenemhat I would eventually begin a co-regency with his son, Senusret, before the elder king was assassinated. His successor, now Senusret I, began a more expansive series of military campaigns before eventually entering a co-regency with his own son, Amenemhat II. His son enjoyed a relatively peaceful reign and eventually chose a traditional joint rule with his successor, Senusret II. The new pharaoh focused mainly on the maintenance of the realm, building a pyramid at el-Lahun as well as attempting to convert the Faiyum oasis into farmland. Under the sole rule of his successor Senusret III, the Middle Kingdom enjoyed the peak of its power and influence.

Built over a two-decade period, the 146.5-metre-high structure was a feat of engineering that put even Imhotep’s Step Pyramid in Sakkara to shame. Giza would become the site of many more pyramids and temples, known as the Giza Necropolis. The Giza 15 Pyramid became the pinnacle of pyramid design in Egypt and it would remain the tallest man-made structure for a staggering 3,800 years. It served as a testament to the power of the pharaohs and the enduring potency of the many Egyptian gods. The Fifth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt (2498 BCE – 2345 BCE) saw an evolution of theological practices across the nation, with certain cults growing in prominence (gods rose and fell in popularity, and usually those favoured by a particular dynasty or geographically important location survived obscurity). The Cult of Ra (god of the noon sun) and the Cult of Osiris (god of the afterlife) rose significantly in popularity during this period of time. The Egyptian economy was also booming, with the influx of goods like ebony, gold, myrrh and frankincense growing all the time. The Egyptians pushed their trading boundaries even further with agreements with Lebanon and modern-day Somalia. In short, it was a time of enterprise without the fear of invasion or war. This economic strength bled into the Sixth Dynasty (2345 BCE – 2181 BCE), as did the growing popularity of the inscription of spells and incantations inside burial chambers and tombs.

There have even been stone vessels (elaborate vases) found in the Step Pyramid tomb of Djoser that pay tribute to Narmer, perhaps expressing an intended connection with the founder and his way of life. Some historians argue that a ruler by the name of Menes was in fact the founder of founders, while others theorise Narmer and Menes were one and the same.

Here, the Chief of Secrets of the House of the Morning (a man tasked with overseeing the monarch’s garments for every occasion) would coordinate the careful clothing of the king by another crew of servants. Since we only have stone pictorials or statues to present the image of the king, it’s easy to assume the Egyptian monarch wore a ceremonial headdress and carried an ankh and cane or flail wherever he went, but this is far from the reality. Of course, for official ceremonies, such as the meeting of dignitaries of public addresses, the king would wear all the paraphernalia, but this was far from the case when it came to the laborious, day-to-day running of a kingdom. The handlers of royal linen, the handlers of the royal crowns and headdresses, and even the director of royal loincloths would all gather around the king and dress him for the day to come. Instead of the opulent gowns and sashes of formal wear, the king would have been dressed in a similar fashion to his courtiers – a simple linen tunic, sandals and a sash around the waist. He wouldn’t have worn the heavy ceremonial crowns commonly seen on statues; instead he would have worn a simple diadem most likely made of silver and gold with a uraeus (a coiling cobra) at the front. From there, the pharaoh would proceed to the temple adjoining the palace. He would pray to the gods and pay tribute alone before moving to the throne room to conduct the first meetings of the day. The king would meet with his advisors and dignitaries from across the land every day, receiving reports from across the kingdom and ordering his officials to oversee certain aspects that require further attention. Of course, while any citizen could petition for an audience with the king, not everyone made it to the throne room. Even those who did may well have only met with the vizier instead. The pharaoh would pass laws into effect, but it seems likely that many of these were ratified by his closest advisors so as not to drown the king in administrative duties.

For 3,000 years a nation united as one, it expanded its horizons across the face of the Earth, erected true Wonders of the World and became one of the most powerful empires history has ever seen. Yet for all those achievements, none would have been possible without the rulers at its head – the kings, the queens and the pharaohs. Through the actions and decisions of over 170 men and women, Egypt became an epicentre for culture and philosophical thinking. It became a place of polytheism, where a pantheon of gods lived in (relative) harmony and informed every facet of daily life. But who were these figureheads and what was their true role in everyday Egyptian society? How did a king or queen rule a kingdom that stretched from the Nile to the Euphrates? These questions have fascinated historians for centuries, and only now are we beginning to understand the responsibilities of a monarch in an age of deeply religious devotion and magical superstition. The role of a pharaoh in Ancient Egypt is a complicated one, full of responsibilities and expectations, but it can be broadly defined by two distinct titles: ‘The Lord of Two Lands’ and ‘High Priest of Every Temple’. Pharaohs were considered both divine figureheads and mortal rulers and as such were involved in everything from godly rituals to dispensing justice. As king, the pharaoh was also the conduit of ma’at (truth, justice, prosperity and cosmic harmony – the key tenets of Ancient Egyptian society), so his sovereignty embodied both temple and state.

They were viewed not as the equal of creationary gods such as Amun-Ra, but as a manifestation of their divinity. In death, a pharaoh was just as influential as they were in life – the Egyptians viewed death not as the end of all things, but the immortalisation of the great and the just. Cults would worship a pharaoh long after their death, while their name and deeds would live on in the constellations named after them and the monumental tombs erected to protect their wealth and prestige. However, the importance of an individual pharaoh was often relative – cults were sometimes disbanded so as to avoid undermining the sanctity of the current regime, while countless tombs and cenotaphs were stripped of their stone and precious limestone in order to facilitate the monumental building of later rulers. As a mortal man, the pharaoh was the most important individual on Earth; surrounded by servants and dignitaries, they would operate from opulent palaces and coordinate religious doctrine with the help of the most prevalent church at the time.

If there was ever a time to act, it was now. Without her powerful Roman lover by her side she needed an ally who could assure her rule, one who wasn’t going to lead a rebellion against her. Brothers, she had learned, could not be trusted. Later that year the youngest Ptolemy was found dead, seemingly poisoned. The people’s grief was muted; the death of Ptolemies, however young, was not so uncommon in Egypt, and besides, the people had a new pharaoh to replace him: the young Caesarion.

Two Macedonian generals, meanwhile, were appointed to oversee them, although Alexander’s system did little to disrupt the life of the country. Traditionally the Egyptian economy had not been run by coin but by trade in kind, and the loss of the Nubian gold mines many years before had deprived the pharaohs of a source of precious metals. The hiring of soldiers and the raising of fleets, however, required hard currency and, even before the arrival of the Persians and then the Greeks, the pharaohs had in recent times employed a Greek general to raise bullion from those who held it – namely the nobility and the priesthood.

As the city became part of the extended Greek Empire, Alexander personally approved its development and transformation into a great metropolis of culture and learning. Its streets were designed to reflect this reforming zeal, with its wide boulevards and Corinthian order columns surrounding a series of temples and vast meeting places.

It is fitting that this sole recorded dream-memory should reference the epic poet, for Alexander strived to embody the Homeric ideal above all. Like Hector or Achilles, he would stand astride history as one of its most celebrated warriors, his deeds in life still echoing down to modern times. According to one of Alexander’s greatest modern biographers, Robin Lane Fox, the Macedonian king feasted upon the words of Homer, “not as a distant reader but more in the spirit of a marcher baron living out the ballads which mirrored his home world.” The seed of that home world was Macedonia, a kingdom lying to the north of Greece. In 356 BCE its king, Philip II, and his queen, Olympias, welcomed the birth of Alexander, who grew up a strong and able-bodied young man. At the age of 16 he acted as regent while his father waged war against the Persians. Two years later he won his laurels commanding the left wing of Philip’s army at the battle of Chaeronea, which brought Athens under the Macedonian yoke. In 336 BCE, Philip was murdered. His son inherited the throne and his father’s Persian campaign. Upon his accession, a confederacy of enemies menaced the young king on all sides, though he quickly crushed the irksome Illyrians and razed rebellious Thebes to the ground. In 334 BCE he crossed the Hellespont into Asia Minor and in Cilica earned one of a number of key victories over the Persians. More victories followed, before he then besieged Tyre and Gaza. The conclusion to the siege of Gaza saw its male population slaughtered and the women and children sold into slavery, as was the custom of the time. The fate of the town’s governor, or certainly the legend that survived, recalls the climax to Homer’s Iliad and Achilles’ treatment of his vanquished enemy Hector: Alexander passed thongs around his enemy’s feet and dragged his battered body through the dust in his chariot’s wake. The fall of Gaza flung open the road to Egypt and in November 332 BCE Alexander entered the most powerful kingdom in the Persian Empire. With their Persian overlord, Darius III, absent following Alexander’s victory at Issus during the previous year, the Egyptians had no protection from this battle-hardened invader and his well- marshalled troops.

But was this the peace treaty the Hittites begged Ramesses to sign after his brutal show of strength during the Battle of Kadesh? Not at all. The true outcome of the Battle of Kadesh was a blood-soaked stalemate. Ramesses was saved from the Hittite chariot ambush by the arrival of reinforcements from the sea.

Ramesses’ grandfather was born Paramessu, a foot soldier who had worked his way up to general in the Egyptian army. He found favour with Horemheb, another lifelong military man who had become pharaoh after the untimely death of the teenage king, Tutankhamun. Horemheb, who had no sons of his own, saw a disciple in Paramessu, someone who would carry on his aggressive campaign of brutal subjugation of rebellious tribes in Nubia, Libya and distant Syria in the name of strengthening the kingdom. When Horemheb died, Paramessu ascended the throne and changed his name to ‘Ramessu beloved of Amun,’ the man history knows as Ramesses I. From birth, Ramesses II was groomed to be pharaoh. His father Seti I inherited the throne 18 months after Ramesses I became king and his son was raised in the lavish royal palaces of the pharaohs, waited upon by nurses and handmaids and trained by tutors in writing, poetry, art and, most importantly, combat. Seti named Ramesses the commander-in-chief of the army when the boy prince was only ten years old. At 14, Ramesses began to accompany his father on military campaigns and witnessed the overwhelming power of the Egyptian charioteers in combat on more than one occasion.

{"context": "Ramesses’ soldiers would have seen their commander-in-chief as the rest of Egypt did: as a god in the flesh possessed of legendary strength and bravery, incapable of error and on a divine mission to re-establish Egypt as the dominant superpower of the Middle East. Ramesses’ destination was Kadesh, a heavily fortified Syrian city in the Orontes River valley. Kadesh was an important centre of trade and commerce and the de facto capital of the Amurru kingdom, a highly coveted piece of land sandwiched on the border between the Egyptian and Hittite empires. As a boy, Ramesses had ridden alongside his father Seti I, when the elder Egyptian king finally wrested Kadesh from the Hittites after more than half a century of abortive attempts. But as soon as Seti returned victorious to Egypt, the scheming rulers of Kadesh re-pledged their allegiance to the Hittites. Ramesses had returned to Syria to salvage two tarnished reputations: his father’s and that of his empire. Ramesses and his army had been marching for a month. They departed from the pharaoh’s royal residence along the eastern edge of the lush Nile Delta in April, cutting across the Sinai peninsula, following the curve of the Mediterranean coastline up through Canaan, past the strategic highland outpost of Meggido, into the fertile valleys of Lebanon and finally arriving in the forests outside Kadesh. The pharaoh’s scouts fanned out to assess the enemy’s preparations for battle. The locals painted a deceptively favourable picture.

{"context": "The government of Ancient Egypt was a theocracy with the pharaoh as absolute monarch. But that doesn’t mean that Ramesses personally oversaw each and every aspect of Egyptian civil life. His chief political officers were two viziers, one each for Upper and Lower Egypt. Serving as chief justices of the Egyptian courts, viziers conducted the tasks of collecting taxes, managing the grain reserves, settling territorial disputes and keeping careful records of rainfall and the Nile’s water levels. Treasurers managed the finances of ‘church’ and state, as well as running the stone quarries that built national shrines. If an average Egyptian had a grievance, he would take it up with the local governors in charge of each of Egypt’s 42 nomes – or states. Governors reported to the viziers, who met daily with the pharaoh for counsel. During his long life, Ramesses renovated or constructed more temples than any pharaoh in all 30 Ancient Egyptian dynasties. He also placed his figure prominently inside each and every one of them, often on equal footing with the gods. At first, this appears to be an unparalleled act of hubris. But seen through the lens of the Egyptian religious mind, this spiritual self-promotion starts to make sense. If the highest goal of Egyptian civilisation is to achieve ma’at or divine harmony, then you need a supreme leader whose very will is in absolute harmony with the gods. Through his numerous construction projects, Ramesses proved his devotion to the gods while also nurturing his own thriving cult of personality. Ramesses built some truly refined and subtle temples, especially his small addition to his father Seti I’s monumental temple complex at Abydos. But refined and subtle was not in his nature. For starters, he liked to do things quickly. In traditional temple construction, all decorative motifs on the outside of a temple were hewn using incised relief, in which images and hieroglyphs are carved into the stone to accentuate the contrast of sun and shadow. In the darkened interiors of temples, however, artists used the more time-consuming bas-relief method, in which drawings and symbols are raised relative to the background. In the interest of time, Ramesses ordered all of his temples to be etched in incise relief inside and out. That’s one reason why Ramesses built more temples than any king before or since.", "question": "What were the main responsibilities of the viziers in Ancient Egypt under the pharaoh?", "answer": "Viziers served as chief justices, collected taxes, managed grain reserves, settled territorial disputes, kept records of rainfall and Nile water levels, and met daily with the pharaoh."}

Nefertiti and her pharaoh husband Akhenaten became embroiled in a religious revolution in which they only worshipped Aten, bringing upheaval to the realm. It’s thought that Nefertiti ruled as Neferneferuaten after Akhenaten’s death, but no one knows for sure. c. 1370-1330 BCE NEFERTITI Brief Bio The ruins of Amarna as seen today, surrounded by inhospitable cliffs But in the fifth year of Amenhotep’s reign, something extraordinary happened. The pharaoh changed his name to Akhenaten, plundered and closed down the temples and threw the priests out of office. After thousands of years of polytheism, he and Nefertiti declared that there was now only one true god: Aten, the sun-disc. And the only way to reach this god was through the pharaoh himself. Akhenaten then led a mass exodus from the ancient capital of Thebes and set about building a new city in the middle of the desert, which he called ‘Amarna’. This was to be the new centre of the Ancient Egyptian empire. The city was surrounded on three sides by inhospitable cliffs – a natural defence against enemies of the crown. The young pharaoh knew that his actions had not been popular, and the rumblings of unrest could be felt across the kingdom. With this religious revolution also came a cultural one. Egyptian art, which before had been stiff and formal, became much more naturalistic. Depictions of Akhenaten took on a far more feminine shape, with rounded hips and a prominent chest.

Ramesses easily took the city and claimed Amurru for Egypt. Expecting a full- scale reprisal by the Hittites, Ramesses was instead greeted by a cadre of Hittite diplomats. The new King Hattusillis had more to worry about than an Egyptian pharaoh with an old vendetta. The Assyrians to the east had amassed wealth and political might that threatened to crush any single empire that stood in its way. But together, Hattusillis proposed, the Hittites and Egyptians could defend their sovereignty. The peace treaty hanging in the UN is a testament to Ramesses’ long-term political vision. He could easily have viewed Hattusillis’ offer as a sign of weakness and attempted to rout the Hittites once and for all. Instead, he saw an opportunity to drop a centuries-old feud that cost Egyptian lives and resources and engaged in an unprecedented act of diplomacy that would bring peace and stability to the kingdom for generations to come. To seal the newly brokered relationship between the Hittites and Egyptians, Ramesses accepted the gift of one of Hattusillis’ daughters as his seventh principal wife. Back in Piramesse, the royal capital, the new Hittite allies proved invaluable to the strengthening of the Egyptian armed forces. The capital city was more than a showcase for the prosperity of the empire. It also housed the pharaoh’s largest armoury, a massive bronze-smelting factory whose blast furnace provided the swords, spears and arrowheads for Egypt’s army.

Peace & prosperity of Amenhotep III were very much the propaganda of the age, but the king ensured these boasts were justified; roads were relaid across the kingdom, with new temples and buildings repaired or rebuilt wherever it was needed. Amenhotep III wanted the whole kingdom to reflect on its hard-fought wealth and status, and it showed. Events during this period have also revealed an equality between Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye. The king was so passionate about his building projects, he often focused all his attention on them – this left much of his political responsibilities to his wife. While these absences weren’t reflective of his entire reign, it still gave the queen the opportunity to prove her political prowess in court and affairs of state. She became a popular head of state and is often portrayed as equal height in pictures of them together – a startling representation of the equality shared between the royal couple. Amenhotep III also paid considerable attention to diplomacy during his reign. Instead of waging wars on the battlefield, the 18th Dynasty monarch used the power of political engagements to maintain Egypt’s relative stability.

It is now known as the Valley of the Kings. c. 1507-1458 BCE HATSHEPSUT Brief Bio S ome of the most powerful individuals of the ancient world, the pharaohs of Egypt were believed to have inherited the throne by divine right and were worshipped as gods on earth. Huge temples were built in their honour, statues were carved in their image and pyramids were built in their memory to ensure their everlasting legacy. However, in what may be one of history’s biggest cover-up operations, one of its greatest rulers has been all but lost to the desert. And the reason behind this monarch’s reign being erased from history would seem pretty trivial to us now: this pharaoh was a woman. In the 16th century BCE, Egypt was experiencing a time of great stability. Founded by Ahmose I in 1543 BCE, the 18th Dynasty marked the start of an era when the empire reached the peak of its power. Once Ahmose had expelled the Hyksos settlers from Lower Egypt and brought the Nile Delta under his control, the nation was politically unified for the first time in more than 500 years. Ahmose reorganised the country’s administration and undertook huge construction projects, which were continued when his successor, Amenhotep I, took the throne in 1526 BCE. It was a time of great strength and stability. Then came the reign of Thutmose I from 1506- 1493 BCE, who extended the empire’s borders further than ever before. When he died, the throne was passed to his son, Thutmose II, who was born to him by one of his minor wives. To secure his kingship, Thutmose II was married to his half- sister, the daughter of Thutmose I. She was therefore of fully royal blood and declared his chief wife. Her name was Hatshepsut. Even at the tender age of 12, Hatshepsut already held a great deal of influence in the royal court. It is likely that Thutmose II was even younger than her, so his wife took the reins when it came to making decisions on both foreign and domestic policy.

A number of unidentified female mummies from the 18th Dynasty were lined up and examined using the latest technology. One of the prime suspects was a mummy from tomb KV60, just in front of tomb KV20, where two women had been found. One could be identified as Hatshepsut’s wet nurse thanks to the inscription on her coffin, the other an obese lady who had been found on the floor next to her. Egyptologists had previously suggested that the mummy could be a royal one due to the positioning of the left arm across its chest, but only now did they have the technology to find out once and for all whether it belonged to Hatshepsut. The team performed CT scans of mummies known to be closely related to her, including the three Thutmoses, to try to create a composite image of the 18th Dynasty facial structure and compare it with the mummies in contention. While doing so, they also decided to scan other objects from the tombs, including a sealed wooden box bearing her cartouche. What this scan revealed proved to be the key to the mystery. In it, along with Hatshepsut’s mummified liver, was a single tooth. Not only was the obese mummy from KV60 missing a tooth, it was also an exact match for the loose one found in the box.

One who caused much speculation was the wife of Thutmose III’s great-great grandson, Nefertiti, as there is evidence that she was promoted to co-regent and possibly ruled as a pharaoh after her husband’s death. It is clear that if she had, the Egyptians did not want her reign to be remembered, as just like Hatshepsut, her name was chiselled off the records and her mummy was even damaged. It would be more than 1,000 years before another female pharaoh would ascend to the Egyptian throne. Her name was Cleopatra and, unlike Hatshepsut, her story would be told in every corner of the globe for millennia to come. “Five ships set out in her name, bringing back frankincense, myrrh and ebony, among other valuable goods” The 18th Dynasty bore many of Egypt’s most famous pharaohs, including Akhenaten, Nefertiti and Tutankhamun Hatshepsut: the queen who became king © Alamy 68 T hink of Ancient Egypt and you might very well imagine a vast empire ruled by god- fearing monarchs; men and women who erected grand tombs and monuments in their honour. But that stereotypical snapshot of the Nile kings is only half the story – for every peaceful period of absolute rule, there was a time when Egypt was divided or controlled almost entirely by foreign powers. Ahmose I, who was the founding king of the 18th Dynasty, was born into such a time. The kingdom he was destined to inherit was bisected by invaders who had dominated Lower Egypt for over a century. And it would be his defence of this long-standing status quo that would define his position as one of Egypt’s most celebrated leaders. To appreciate the gravity of Ahmose I’s actions at the beginning of the 18th Dynasty, and the effect it would have on the country for centuries to come, you have to travel back to the reign of his father, Seqenenre Tao. Tao ruled from 1560 BCE to 1558 BCE, but his time on the throne, like many before him, was blighted by an occupying force to the north of the country. Around 1720 BCE, a nation of Semitic tradesman and warriors from Asia known as the Hyksos had invaded and occupied the Nile Delta, establishing a separate realm to the rest of Egypt.

By controlling this city, the Theban ruler drives the invaders towards Canaan. 1529-1528 BCE Ahmose I is also famous for being the last Egyptian monarch to have a pyramid erected on native soil. With one foot planted in the golden years of his kingdom’s past, Ahmose I desired a prosperous new age for his people. His successes overseas had boosted the economy and he wanted to express it in the most lavish way possible, with a pyramid. It would be a monument to his life and achievements, and would stand for all time in his homeland. Interestingly, Ahmose’s pyramid wasn’t built as a tomb, but rather a cenotaph (in other words, a purely ceremonial monument). It was built near Thebes, in what we now know as Abydos, and was completed in the final years of his reign. It was constructed from sand and rubble, as was the tradition of the time, with limestone used as a casing to hold the pyramid in place. When it was completed, it had a base length of around 52.5m (172ft) and a height of 40m (130 ft). While it was considerably smaller than the grandest of tombs found elsewhere in the country (the Pyramid of Giza stands at a colossal 130m), it would have still been an impressive sight among the temples of Thebes. Tragically, the pyramid didn’t survive; it was mostly stripped off its precious limestone for other buildings in the years after Ahmose’s death and the rest of the construct soon crumbled. Only a pile of rubble 10m high remains where it once stood. Like many pharaohs, the date of Ahmose’s death isn’t certain, but the most common theory cites 1525 BCE.

Originally thought to be the body of a 50-year-old man, later studies suggest he died in his 30s. However, some clues – such as a lack of similar physical characteristics and the fact his arms weren’t crossed on his chest, as per the tradition – suggest the remains may not even be those of Ahmose I. The state of his remains also reveals an intriguing post-mortem history. His tomb was discovered in 1881 within the Deir el-Bahri (a complex network of mortuary temples located in the Theban Necropolis) alongside fellow 18th Dynasty monarchs such as Amenhotep I and Thutmose I, but it’s believed his body was originally interred at Dra’ Abu el-Naga (located nearby on the West Bank of the Nile). So why was his body moved from one necropolis to another? The strips of cloth wrapped around a mummified body are often marked with hieratic script to denote the high-ranking individual and his family, but the cloth surrounding Ahmose I’s body contained his name and that of a monarch who ruled Egypt 400 years later – the priest-king Pinedjem II.

Meanwhile, the relics of Hatshepsut’s reign continued to stand proud on the Egyptian skyline, her towering obelisks and imposing statues casting a shadow in her memory upon the land she once called hers. However, towards the end of Thutmose’s regency, he ordered that his stepmother’s cartouches and images be chiselled away, and her statues torn down, disfigured and smashed before being buried in a pit. There was even an attempt at Karnak to surround her obelisks with walls. Various theories have been given to explain this sudden and dramatic turn of events. Some argue that this was carried out as a typical act of self-promotion during Thutmose’s waning years, while others suggest it was simply a money-saving method whereby existing buildings could be accredited to the current king. It has been suggested that when Thutmose came of age, he demoted Hatshepsut back to the role of regent, and attempted to eliminate any evidence of her as pharaoh to claim that the royal succession ran directly to him from his father.

{"context": "American Egyptologist Mark Lehner speculates that a spiralling ramp may have begun in the stone quarry to the southeast and continued around the pyramid. The blocks were drawn into place along on sleds that were lubricated by water or milk. More recently, the French Egyptologist Jean Pierre Houdin has used 3D imaging to identify an anomalous spiral structure within Khufu’s pyramid. Houdin proposes a theory based around an internal ramp: a regular external ramp was used for the first 30 per cent of the pyramid, then a spiralling internal ramp transported the blocks beyond that height. Levering methods would have complemented the ramp structure. The blocks may have been lifted incrementally, using wooden wedges to gradually move the stones upwards.

The men expected to find treasure, but Al-Ma’mun himself was intrigued by a legend that the pyramid contained a book of limitless historical knowledge. To get inside, they used brute force. They used fire and battering rams to gain entry. Previously, in a fit of religious fanaticism, the sultan of Egypt, Al-Aziz Uthman (1171-1198), had attempted to demolish Khufu’s pyramid.

A colossal undertaking at the time, the creation of the Step Pyramid at Sakkara suggests that Djoser’s kingdom was not only substantially solvent at the time, but also relatively peaceful.

Those early cinematic depictions of Imhotep as a maniacal holy man may have sent chills down the spines of audiences, but that fictional detail has roots in reality, too. Religion was a key part of Ancient Egyptian life – the actions, wisdom and favour of the gods permeated every facet of life, so it seemed appropriate that the inquisitive mind of Imhotep would find intellectual refuge in the church.

The pyramid at Sakkara The choice to use regular stone for King Djoser’s step pyramid was not revolutionary in itself, but using stone blocks to construct something as huge as a pyramid was unheard of. In order to hold the structure in place, Imhotep used fine limestone (an expensive commodity at the time) with packing in between. He incorporated the basic design of the traditional flat-roofed mastaba, but instead made each section a square rather than a rectangle. Each ‘step’ was constructed by building in accretion layers that leant inwards towards the core of the structure (rather than the flat, horizontal building technique used on mastabas) – this design choice was crucial, since the structure needed to be strong enough to hold itself in place without imploding. Imhotep added a passageway within the structure that led directly to the sarcophagus chamber, as well as a complicated network of tunnels and chambers. The pyramid itself was created as a means of holding and protecting the king’s remains and treasures, but it also formed a vital part of a larger complex. A number of buildings, statues and pillars were constructed on site, all of which were surrounded by a stone wall that reached 10.7 metres (35 feet) high and was encased in limestone.

He may have been immortalised on the silver screen in the 20th century as an occult priest with a thirst for vengeance and immortality, but the reality we can discern from the records of the earliest of the Egyptian eras reveals a very different man – someone upon whom immortality was thrust, long after his consent could have been obtained. Records surrounding Imhotep’s earliest years are patchy, but estimates place his date of birth in the vicinity of 2650 BCE. His father is said to have been a man named Kanofer, who was a celebrated architect; his mother is said to have a woman called Khreduonkh from the province of Mendes. The particulars of his childhood and his ascent into young manhood remain shrouded in even deeper layers of mystery, but it’s clear that, at some point in the early years of King Djoser’s reign, the young man was rising in prominence. A veritable polymath, Imhotep became famed for his intellect. He worked as a scribe and learned his trade as an engineer, two careers that would do him well in the court of the pharaoh. He also turned his attention to medicine, and it was in this field that Imhotep forged just one of his many legacies. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, so named after the dealer who purchased it in 1862, is purported to be based on the works and cases of Imhotep himself and describes in incredible detail the types of procedures performed on patients in the age of the Old Kingdom. The document itself, a rarity considering it depicts applicable medicine rather than arcane treatments also attributed to the era, was written around 1700 BCE, but is likely based on medical practices performed a thousand years previous. It describes around 48 procedures, ranging from the treatment of head traumas to tumours and spinal issues. Whether this document was truly based on Imhotep’s own work or simply inspired by his legend isn’t clear, but his medical genius was undisputed and would drive his later deification. However, it should be said that Imhotep was not a man of pure science in a world that clung to magic and superstition. To the Ancient Egyptians, magic and science were one, and Imhotep is as likely to have studied and conducted practices as a sage as he would have as a physician.

Interestingly, our insights and knowledge about Ancient Egypt have been informed by the written reports of Greek and Roman scholars who travelled to Egypt between the fifth century and the second century BCE. Key writers include Hecateus of Mitetus in 500 BCE. Hecateus’s work Periodos Ges (alternative title, Periegesis, meaning ‘Tour of the World’) offers useful insights into what daily life was like. He writes that Egypt is “the gift of the Nile” in a phrase that ably articulates the fascination that has endured for so many over the subsequent centuries. In the artwork of Ancient Egypt, the human figures who feature largest in any given image on a monument would have had the most social capital and standing. The lower a person’s position in the social order, the smaller their image in public art. Suffice it to say, Ancient Egyptian society and its structure adhered to a very strict sense of long- established social hierarchy. In the Third Dynasty, the pharaoh Djoser unified the country and established a very clear social order based around the capital at Memphis in northern Egypt, just south of the fanlike shape of the Nile delta, which was comprised of tributaries that ran out to the Mediterranean. Under Djoser’s reign, the Old Kingdom era flourished, and it was during this period that kings were regarded as gods on earth and pyramids were raised in their honour. However, residing above all people – pharaohs included – were the many multiple deities, such as Ra, Osiris and Isis. In terms of society and social structure of Ancient Egypt, we have to think about a culture that spanned 3,000 years, reaching from the Predynastic period through to the time of Ptolemy. Across the three millennia of this period, we can identify five key elements that shape our understanding of the society: kinship (connection between blood relatives and through marriage), location (connection between people born in the same place or who live in the same place), gender (connection between people of the same sex and sexual orientation), age (connection between people of the same age), and social class (connection between people born into the same social standing).

Ramesses even placed his mortuary temple, the Ramesseum, along the banks of the upper Nile in Thebes. It doubled as a reserve bank and could hold 350 boatloads of grain, ready for shipment in the event of a poor harvest. The pharaohs relied on astronomer priests to read the stars in order to gauge the timings of seasonal floods, which were essential for agriculture. Ramesses used marker stones in the upper Nile to carefully record river levels; he would then send word to the Delta cities when the waters began to swell.

A farmer would have been required to take some of his harvest to the temple as payment for using the temple land. Evening meals for the family were modest. Bread and fruit would have been staples of the everyman’s daily diet, and beer was a commonly consumed drink. In contrast with the ordinary labourer’s home, the homes of the elite were well appointed. Key to the day-to-day running of the household were the slaves, who would assist an elite man in washing and shaving for the day ahead. Husband and wife would boast a servant each to assist their morning preparations, in addition to servants who would get the children ready for the day ahead. A nobleman would also employ a man to supervise his land in terms of arable and pastoral work. The homes of Egyptians were constructed from a combination of mud and papyrus, the climate understandably informing the kind of building materials used. However, with the Nile flooding annually, materials shifted to bricks made from clay and mud. Among so many other things that we can thank the Egyptians for, the word ‘adobe’, which stems from the Egyptian word dbe, meaning ‘mudbrick’ can be attributed to them. Contrasting with the very modest conditions of most Egyptian homes, those of the elite might have as many as 30 rooms, as well as a garden with space enough for many guests. The flat roof of an Egyptian house meant that it could be used as another living space, which was especially handy for the poorest of society. They lived in single-room houses that were furnished primarily with mats and perhaps a single stool. To keep the sunlight and heat at bay, windows would be covered with reed mats. There was also no running water, so it would have been sourced from a local well. For all of its seeming remoteness from our own lives, the daily lives of a typical family in Ancient Egypt revolved around an extended family, particularly among the rural communities. Away from these rural communities, in a city like Memphis or Thebes, houses were in close proximity to each other.

However, we can also say that Ancient Egypt was a culture that recognised the more broadly enriching value of education as a way of deepening one’s understanding of the world. As we might typically expect to be the case, it was in the family unit where a child would learn and develop their value system. Boys had the opportunity to be trained in the work that interested them, but girls did not have this opportunity available to them. Education, then, would have extended to include imparting younger family members with a code of morality (with its emphasis on maintaining order at both individual and broader social levels) and training for a particular kind of work, whether agricultural, craftwork, medicine or work as an administrator. Each kind of job carried with it a certain social standing. What we know about education in Ancient Egypt is derived significantly from The Books Of Instruction, which offer us a fascinating insight into the dynamics of social life and the expectation of right behaviour. Historian J M Roberts writes that “the bureaucracy directed a country most of whose inhabitants were peasants,” making the distinction between what we might call “the haves” and “the have nots”. Thousands of Egyptian boys would have been educated to work as scribes (in Egyptian the word sesh meant ‘to draw’), and a school dedicated to this was located at Thebes. However, we need to be mindful that this education was enjoyed by only a minority and that almost all Egyptians did not undertake a formal education.

The concept of isfet incorporated, illness, injustice, disease, disorder and death, while ma’at was synonymous with justice, balance and the preservation of cosmic law. This concept of divine order was personified in the person of the goddess Ma’at, the favoured daughter of Ra who travelled alongside him in his Sun boat. She was to be loved and honoured by all human kings, and images survive of rulers standing with Ma’at at their side, her identity clearly marked by a tall ostrich feather. Upon death, kings would be judged by how well they had honoured her by embracing her values. Ra always kept Ma’at in his heart. The great solar god Ra is perhaps the most famous Egyptian deity, though he was honoured most highly at Heliopolis. Different regions favoured different gods, even during the rule of the pharaohs.

The union between brother and sister begot the Earth god Geb and the sky goddess Nut, who, in turn, produced Osiris, Seth, Isis and Nephthys. This family was known as the Ennead of Heliopolis. Elsewhere, at Hermopolis, the creation myth spoke of eight gods. The city was known as Khemnu, which means ‘eight town’. This myth is less well preserved than that of Heliopolis, but fragments record four pairs of deities, Nun and Naunet, Heh and Hauhey, Kek and Kauket and Amen and Amaunet.

The atmosphere of each was markedly different. The Nile Valley, bordered on each side by desert and mountains, offered an entirely insular and traditional way of life, fully focused on the life-giving river, which, when in flood, fed the fertile Black Land on its banks. Beyond it was the barren Red Land, and popular thought separated the two. One was the land of the living, home to food, flora and fauna; the other the land of the dead, the abode of graveyards, ghosts and the wild animals of the turbulent god Seth. Life in Lower Egypt was different. The air was cooler and more moist. The sea, and land access to Libya, allowed a little more influence from foreign lands. It is said that the people of Egypt always considered these two lands as separate countries, though united under one crown. “This ideal of a balanced tension between two matched, opposing forces was a constantly repeated theme in all of Egypt’s myths,” wrote the scholar Joyce Tyldesley.

Despite their distant place in history, Ancient Egyptians were quite advanced in their ability to diagnose a variety of ailments and illnesses (both long-forgotten and familiar). The remedies they used were almost entirely drawn from nature, so many of them have survived to today as modern herbal medicines and alternative treatments. Almost all of our knowledge of these diagnoses come from the incredibly detailed records in the Edwin Smith Papyrus (c. 1600 BCE), the Berlin Medical Papyrus (c. 1250 BCE), the Kahun Papyrus (c. 1900 BCE), the London Medical Papyrus (c. 1250 BCE) and the Ebers Papyrus (c. 1600 BCE) – each of which details the Egyptians’ knowledge of disease, anatomy and healing. These texts express an incredibly precise understanding of human anatomy – the practice of mummification gave those involved a deeply intimate knowledge of the body’s composition and natural balances. And considering that many physicians were also priests, it seems possible surgeons would have cut their teeth in the sanctity of mummification before The papyri unearthed in the last few hundred years have radically changed our understanding of ancient Egyptian medicine. Egyptian doctors recorded countless procedures and diagnoses in detail, creating a unique insight into how a healer in this era identified and treated everything from inflammation to depression. The Ebers Papyrus, purchased by German Egyptologist Georg Ebers in the winter of 1873-1874 in Luxor, is one such document. A 100-page scroll roughly 20 metres long, the papyrus dates back to around 1550 BCE, making it one of the oldest medical papyri ever discovered. Another early medical document, the Brugsch Papyrus (1300-1200 BCE) provides similar information to the Ebers.

It contains incantations and spells to banish disease-causing demons alongside incredibly detailed – and accurate – descriptions of the heart.

He is sometimes described as the father of the gods, ‘eldest of the originals’, a self-made divinity who created all through the power of thought and speech. One particular hymn that compresses the Egyptian pantheon to just three gods cites Amen as the hidden power, Ra as the visible power in the heavens and Ptah as the divine power made manifest upon the Earth. Ptah Seth Osiris The source of light, energy and life, he takes his name from the Egyptian word for Sun. His cult appears to have originated in Heliopolis (the Greek name for Iunu, meaning city of the Sun god), and from the 26th century BCE to the Roman period, rulers of Egypt were considered his sons. He could appear in many forms and is depicted either as a man with the head of a falcon, ram or beetle, or sometimes as a winged Sun, or else as a simple falcon. The Sun disc, burning in the sky, might be Ra or his daughter, the Eye of Ra. His favoured daughter, meanwhile, was cited as Ma’at, whose name translates as ‘the divine order’. It is said that Ra was born each morning to his mother, the sky goddess, and passed through a number of transformations before returning to her fold in the evening. Sometimes the Sun’s journey across the sky was imagined as Ra’s perpetual voyage, with 12 hours spent above the Earth and 12 hours spent below. The 12 hours of the day were often personified as solar gods and goddesses. The priests of Ra at Heliopolis worked fervently through the night to ensure he passed safely through the night cycle and returned again in the morning. Ra Among the most famous of all Egyptian myths is the death and resurrection of Osiris. He ruled with his sister-wife Isis as a wise and just king until his chaotically inclined brother, Seth, struck him down. It was decreed that he should rise again and rule the land of the dead, while his son Horus, after defeating Seth, should rule the land of the living. He himself died by either drowning or trampling, or perhaps both, dying a double death. Some sources claimed that Seth, on hearing that the devoted Isis was travelling through Egypt searching for her consort-brother’s body, seized the cadaver upon its discovery and dramatically tore it into pieces, scattering the body across the country with different towns each receiving a portion. Osiris’s resurrection, however, was assured.", "question": "Where did the cult of the sun god Ra appear to originate?", "answer": "Heliopolis, also known as Iunu, meaning city of the Sun god."}

Seth was cited as the murderer of his brother Osiris, the protector of the fertile Nile valley, and was his sibling’s opposite, representing chaos and the harsh, unforgiving desert in the outlands. This association earned him the epithet ‘The Red One’. In mythic tales, he took the form of dangerous animals, like bulls, wild cats and crocodiles, and was linked to the fantastical griffin. His conflict with Osiris is shrouded in mystery, although some thought his murderous assault was prompted by his passion for his brother’s bride, Isis. The Greek historian Plutarch, meanwhile, thought that “the brilliant Seth, who so longed to be king, was forced to stand by while his dull but worthy brother ruled.” After his murderous act, Seth reigned as a usurper, which brought him into conflict with his brother’s posthumous son, Horus. One myth says that their legal struggle lasted for 80 years. In the temples of Horus, their story ends with Seth’s ultimate annihilation. About 20 miles from Heliopolis lay Memphis, the capital city of Egypt and the home of the creator deity Ptah. Often depicted with a blue face and a straight beard, Ptah was especially close to builders and craftsmen, and often wore an artisan’s skullcap. Ptah was important to human kings, on whom he bestowed his qualities, personified by his paraphernalia – the ankh (a looped cross signifying life), the was (a symbol of dominion) and the djed (a symbol of stability), all of which were combined in his sceptre. His wife was Sekhmet, a leonine solar goddess, was said to be a tool of divine retribution, while his avatar on Earth was the sacred Apis bull, the most important animal in ancient Egypt.

The temple housed the cult of Amun-Re, the most important deity in Thebes and dedicated to various gods and goddesses. Egyptian cult temples all share a similar design. However, as Karnak began to grow in importance, the edifice grew larger and more complex. Each pharaoh extended the temple in an attempt to outdo their predecessors in personal piety. Eager to impress the gods, each king embellished the temple with beautiful masonry and enormous pylons, and decorating the complex with elaborate imagery and military texts. The temple acted as a ‘generator’ of spiritual energy. It was seen as a bridge between the Earth and cosmic realms. Highly visible to the populace, its walls were designed to instil both awe and fear. At Karnak, a religious ceremony would have commemorated the establishment of the first temple stone. The foundations consisted of sand- filled trenches; although primitive, these proved highly substantial. The temple pylons (weighing thousands of tons) are still standing. Pylons, columns, subsidiary temples and chapels were crafted in sandstone, basalt and granite. Mined from established quarries, the stones were removed in blocks using stone-tipped drills and pounders. Monolithic blocks (used for colossal statuary) were excavated in one single piece.

{"context": "Surgery was another important factor of day- to-day Ancient Egyptian medical practice. More importantly, it wasn’t a speciality as it is now, but a necessity for every physician to know and practise whenever and wherever it was needed. Most procedures that took place, according to the evidence we have to draw from, were focused on external trauma, and none was ever conducted inside the body. Interestingly, many of the surgical procedures we commonly see today – eye surgery, dental surgery and those involving childbirth – were either never performed or no evidence has been found to confirm their existence at this time. More bizarre still is that no records exist relating to dental or eye surgeries involving nobles or even the pharaohs themselves – an especially curious factor when you consider the importance of the eye in Egyptian symbology. The only evidence available confirms the use of topical remedies for eye maladies and nothing more. Surgery became an advanced part of Ancient Egyptian medical practice because, unlike other civilisations at this stage in their development, the Egyptians had already developed a robust written language. This enabled physicians and healers to record certain diagnoses and treatments, and mark those that worked and those that didn’t. Sadly, no early medical textbooks have survived from this period, but texts such as the Edwin Smith Papyrus are believed to have been based on such notes and collected experience, hence the importance they play in our understanding of how such practices were conducted. The Egyptians divided potential surgery cases into three separate categories: treatable, contestable and untreatable. A treatable case was something a physician could solve immediately, while a contestable diagnosis was based on the assessment that a patient could survive in their current state. If the patient showed resilience, a healer could then select the appropriate surgical procedure to conduct. All surgeries were topical only. No invasive procedures were performed, purely because no forms of anaesthetic were available at the time, save alcohol. We know that the Egyptians reset bones with splints and stitched up large open wounds and complications of the skin.

And that intimate knowledge was what gave the Ancient Egyptian healer the power to deal with almost any ailment. “When you come across a swelling of the flesh in any part of the body of a patient and your patient is clammy and the swelling comes and goes under the finger,” reads the Ebers Papyrus (c. 1500 BCE) in regards to diagnosing swelling and a potential tumour, “then you must say to your patient: ‘It is a tumour of the flesh. I will treat the disease. I will try to heal it with fire since cautery heals’. When you come across a swelling that has attacked a channel, then it has formed a tumour in the body. If when you examine it with your fingers, it is like a hard stone, then you should say: ‘It is a tumour of the channels. I shall treat the disease with a knife.’ ” The use of fire remains an alarming means of treating any sort of swelling, but the most striking element is the bedside manner.

This papyrus copy is based on a late Egyptian temple at Denderah Back in 2000, British Egyptologist Dr Kate Spence proposed a theory for the way in which the architects of the time managed to align the pyramids with such accuracy. Dr Spence details that degree of precision: “The Great Pyramid is extremely accurately aligned towards north. The sides deviate from true north by less than three arc minutes – that’s less than a 20th of a degree – which is extremely accurate in terms of orientation.” What Dr Spence’s theory underscored was the faculty of the Ancient Egyptians to embrace and exploit the discipline of astronomy as a means of navigation and orientation. The Greek historian Herodotus commented in his work The Histories that “the Egyptians were the first of all men on Earth to find out the course of the year, having divided the seasons into 12 parts to make up the whole; and this they said they found out from the stars…” From the Egyptians, modern astronomy was able to develop a more refined sense of the repeating, cyclical patterns of the stars and planets in the night sky.

Ebers was a German Egpytologist who unearthed the papyrus document at Thebes in 1873-74. By 1000 BCE, Egyptian culture had begun to determine medicine as an evidence-based practice. That said, the culture still found a place for magic in healing. Because of their trading success as a culture, a wide range of plants and spices were introduced into Egypt by traders who had ventured far beyond the land around the river Nile. Egyptian physicians explored and established the potential of drugs and plants as having medicinal value. This work was then taken up by the Ancient Greeks who, taking it home from their travels, then saw it disseminated across Europe. Egyptian doctors even made the connection between the human pulse and the human heartbeat. Inspired by the evidence of irrigation channels that farmers dug, physicians postulated that such channels also existed within the human body and so must be kept free from obstruction to maintain health.

When Napoleon set sail to the Orient on 19 May 1789 with his 17,000 troops and machines of war, he also brought over 150 engineers, scientists, scholars, architects, surveyors and cartographers who were eager to map and study the wonders they could unearth.

A thirst for the wonders of Ancient Egypt swept through Napoleon’s army, and even the ambitious young general himself began to catch the fever. Over the next century, dozens of tombs, chambers and caches were unearthed by archaeologists and explorers from all over the world. But there was still one tomb that remained hidden: that of a little- known boy king who sat on the throne for less than ten years Tutankhamun. Howard Carter was not a likely candidate for the discovery of this vault of ancient treasure that had eluded so many others. The son of an artist, his introduction to Egyptian history came as a result of his own artistic abilities and lack of formal schooling. He was first employed, aged just 17, to copy scenes from tomb walls. He accompanied skilled excavator Flinders Petrie as the latter began to uncover clues about the mysterious Pharaoh Tutankhamun. The young Carter had no idea who this king was, but he felt the buzz surrounding him, and the rumour that somewhere in the vast desert of sand lay his tomb, untouched and bursting full of precious ancient treasures, alighted his boyish curiosity.

Although he quickly rose through the ranks, Carter’s fiery and stubborn personality got the better of him when he refused to apologise after encouraging Egyptian guards to defend themselves against French tourists who had assaulted them. He left the Antiquities Service for good and became a free agent. Meanwhile, Theodore M Davis, a private sponsor of the Antiquities Service, and his team had made a curious discovery in the Valley of the Kings. What they had unearthed was a small site with a few artefacts bearing Tutankhamun’s name. The discovery was decidedly underwhelming, but Davis was convinced he had finally discovered the plundered tomb of the king. In his publication, concerning the discovery he wrote, “I fear the Valley of the Kings is now exhausted.” Carter did not agree. Now unemployed and scraping a living by selling his paintings to wealthy visitors, he hardly had the funds required to pursue his suspicions that Davis’ discovery was not the true tomb. But he was in luck. The lure of Egypt and its many secrets had drawn in the wealthy but frail George Herbert, Fifth Earl of Carnarvon. Both men were eager to make a spectacular discovery, and both men needed the other’s skills and resources to do it.

However, their peers viewed the pair as idealistic and naive, warning them that the only thing that would be discovered in their search would likely be the bottom of the Earl’s wallet. Undeterred, Carter set about searching for the tomb he thoroughly believed existed. Initially interrupted by World War I, Carter was finally free to continue the excavations in 1917, working his way from the surface down to the bedrock of the valley floor. It was long, exhausting work, and it was estimated Carter’s team moved 150,000 to 200,000 tons of rubble in the relentless Egyptian sun.

Egypt was a culture that, to some degree, combined an affinity for magic with a fascination for the world of reason and evidence-based thought and investigation. One of the key texts that survived the immense passage of human history was The Book of the Dead, dating from the 16th Dynasty, which was discovered in the coffin of Queen Mentuhotep. The Book of the Dead is a narrative that provides us with an insight into Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife. The book powerfully combines writing and illustration for a culture that embraced the sombre reality of death and the ceaseless importance of a disciplined and ordered life.

In these very earliest hieroglyphs we see depictions of cattle and farmers and the motivation behind recording aspects of their lives was to memorialise these details of life that held most importance for them. Key to understanding hieroglyphs is recognising that they function as ideograms. Ideograms are, as Egyptologist Ian Shaw explains, “signs employed as direct representations of phenomena such as ‘sky’ or ‘man’) as well as phonetic signs representing the sound of all or part of a spoken word…” Hieroglyphs didn’t only provide factual information. They also allowed for creative and artistic expression and interpretation. Indeed, some hieroglyphs are described as ‘determinative’ because a given hieroglyph determines the full meaning. Hieroglyphs were most particularly used on temples and the great public buildings and monuments of Ancient Egypt.

This type of scholarly competition reflected something of the much broader tension that had existed between France and Britain at the time. In an attempt to weaken Britain, Napoleon had decided on an offensive on British claims in Egypt in order to disrupt Britain’s hugely successful venture in North Africa and emerging connections to India. The artefact was named the Rosetta Stone after El Rashid – the location in the Nile Delta, just about 35 miles north of Alexandria, where it was discovered. And this inconspicuous chunk of granite rock has become a globally recognised archaeological treasure. Relatively swiftly after its discovery, it granted access to the thought- and idea-scape, daily life and religious systems of a culture that has entranced and energised people’s imaginations for centuries. The Rosetta Stone, then, provided something of a quantum leap by allowing scholars to understand with great clarity, and then share, the story of Ancient Egypt. The Stone itself did not narrate the history of Ancient Egypt or anything equally expansive. No: the stone itself records a public decree made by the teenage pharaoh, Ptolemy V. However, this very particular text would eventually allow translators to work out the linguistic system on which Egyptian writing was based. It became the key to unlocking a long-lost corridor of knowledge through to the time of the Ancient Egyptians. We use that term to distinguish the culture from an even older civilisation that had developed around the River Nile. As Dr Penelope Wilson has commented, “Ancient Egyptian is classed by linguists as an Afro-Asiatic language. This means that it is related to North African languages such as Berber and Cushitic, and to Asiatic (or Semitic) languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew.” In 1810, the Royal Society of Antiquaries in London published a document entitled Rosetta Stone, brought to England in 1802: account of by Matt.

The Rosetta Stone comprises three types of writing, each of which recorded what has been entitled The Memphis Decree. Having been the capital city of Ancient Egypt, Memphis was located just south of the Nile Delta, 15 miles to the south of Cairo. The contents of the decree refer to the young pharaoh Ptolemy V, who the Greek text describes as follows: “King Ptolemy, living for ever, the Manifest God whose excellence is fine…” It continues in Egyptian hieroglyphs in the uppermost section; the middle section shows Demotic Egyptian writing (used for document writing rather than writing about sacred subjects); and the lowest third shows Ancient Greek text. The Rosetta Stone is a veritable search engine of the Ancient Egyptian time. Professor Kathryn A Bard has explained that Egyptian writing was borne out of royal administrative requirements.

(The Faiyum Oasis was a region of ancient Egypt known for its fertility and the abundance of plant and animal life.) 7) Ra, the sun god in his many forms. 8) Amon, a creator god often linked with Ra. 9) Ptah, another creator god and the patron of craftsmen. 10) Anubis, god of mummification. 11) Osiris, god of agriculture and ruler of the dead. 12) Isis, wife of Osiris, mother of Horus and Mistress of Magic.
