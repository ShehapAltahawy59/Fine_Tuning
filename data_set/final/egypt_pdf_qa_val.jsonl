He  found favour with Horemheb, another  lifelong military man who had become  pharaoh after the untimely death of the  teenage king, Tutankhamun.

His father Seti I inherited the  throne 18 months after Ramesses I became  king and his son was raised in the lavish  royal palaces of the pharaohs, waited upon by  nurses and handmaids and trained by tutors  in writing, poetry, art and, most importantly,  combat.

Kadesh was an important centre of trade  and commerce and the de facto capital of the \nAmurru kingdom, a highly coveted piece of land  sandwiched on the border between the Egyptian  and Hittite empires.

For  starters, he liked to do things quickly. In traditional  temple construction, all decorative motifs on the  outside of a temple were hewn using incised relief,  in which images and hieroglyphs are carved into  the stone to accentuate the contrast of sun and  shadow. In the darkened interiors of temples,  however, artists used the more time-consuming  bas-relief method, in which drawings and symbols  are raised relative to the background.

Over 250 statues, temples, buildings  and steles (clay tablets usually created to promote  the successes and absolute sovereignty of a  monarch) were constructed over his time as king. \nAmenhotep III commissioned a new pleasure  palace at Malkata (located on the West Bank of  the Nile, opposite Thebes) and a staggering 600  statues of the goddess Sekhmet at the Temple of \nMut at Karnak.

It is now known  as the Valley of the Kings. c. 1507-1458 BCE \nHATSHEPSUT\nBrief \nBio\nS ome of the most powerful individuals of  the ancient world, the pharaohs of Egypt  were believed to have inherited the throne  by divine right and were worshipped as  gods on earth. Huge temples were built in  their honour, statues were carved in their image  and pyramids were built in their memory to  ensure their everlasting legacy. However, in what  may be one of history’s biggest cover-up  operations, one of its greatest rulers  has been all but lost to the desert. \nAnd the reason behind this  monarch’s reign being erased  from history would seem  pretty trivial to us now: this  pharaoh was a woman. \nIn the 16th century BCE, \nEgypt was experiencing a time  of great stability. Founded by \nAhmose I in 1543 BCE, the 18th \nDynasty marked the start of an era  when the empire reached the peak  of its power. Once Ahmose had expelled  the Hyksos settlers from Lower Egypt and brought  the Nile Delta under his control, the nation was  politically unified for the first time in more than \n500 years. Ahmose reorganised the country’s  administration and undertook huge construction  projects, which were continued when his successor, \nAmenhotep I, took the throne in 1526 BCE. It was a  time of great strength and stability.\nThen came the reign of Thutmose I from 1506-\n1493 BCE, who extended the empire’s borders  further than ever before. When he died, the throne  was passed to his son, Thutmose II, who was born  to him by one of his minor wives. To secure his  kingship, Thutmose II was married to his half- sister, the daughter of Thutmose I. She  was therefore of fully royal blood and  declared his chief wife. Her name  was Hatshepsut. \nEven at the tender age of 12, \nHatshepsut already held a great  deal of influence in the royal  court. It is likely that Thutmose \nII was even younger than her,  so his wife took the reins when  it came to making decisions on  both foreign and domestic policy. \nHer husband was physically frail too,  as his thin and scab-riddled mummy  would reveal, and he ruled for no longer than", "question": "When was the 18th Dynasty founded, and by whom?", "answer": "The 18th Dynasty was founded by Ahmose I in 1543 BCE."}

One  could be identified as Hatshepsut’s wet nurse thanks to  the inscription on her coffin, the other an obese lady who  had been found on the floor next to her. \nEgyptologists had previously suggested that the  mummy could be a royal one due to the positioning of  the left arm across its chest, but only now did they have  the technology to find out once and for all whether it  belonged to Hatshepsut. The team performed CT scans  of mummies known to be closely related to her, including  the three Thutmoses, to try to create a composite image  of the 18th Dynasty facial structure and compare it with  the mummies in contention. While doing so, they also  decided to scan other objects from the tombs, including a  sealed wooden box bearing her cartouche. What this scan  revealed proved to be the key to the mystery.

With one foot planted in the golden  years of his kingdom’s past, Ahmose I desired a  prosperous new age for his people. His successes  overseas had boosted the economy and he wanted  to express it in the most lavish way  possible, with a pyramid. It would  be a monument to his life and  achievements, and would stand  for all time in his homeland. \nInterestingly, Ahmose’s  pyramid wasn’t built as a  tomb, but rather a cenotaph \n(in other words, a purely  ceremonial monument). It was  built near Thebes, in what we  now know as Abydos, and was  completed in the final years of his  reign. It was constructed from sand and  rubble, as was the tradition of the time, with  limestone used as a casing to hold the pyramid  in place. When it was completed, it had a base  length of around 52.5m (172ft) and a height of 40m \n(130 ft).

A number  of historians have also argued over the length of \nDjoser’s reign, but most agree that he ruled for just  under three decades. In that time, Djoser funded  and commissioned the first pyramid ever built on \nEgyptian soil. A colossal undertaking at the time, the  creation of the Step Pyramid at Sakkara suggests  that Djoser’s kingdom was not only substantially  solvent at the time, but also relatively peaceful. Wars \n– both domestic and foreign – empty treasuries, so  it’s unlikely Djoser was engaged in any significant  conflicts during his time as king.\nThose early cinematic depictions of Imhotep as  a maniacal holy man may have sent chills down  the spines of audiences, but that fictional detail  has roots in reality, too. Religion was a key part of \nAncient Egyptian life – the actions, wisdom and  favour of the gods permeated every facet of life,   so it seemed appropriate that the inquisitive mind  of Imhotep would find intellectual refuge in the  church. He entered the church of Ra – the Sun god  often linked with the local deity equivalent known  as Atum – and quickly rose to the position of High \nPriest. The city of Memphis was the capital at the  time, and the home of the pharaoh himself – it  would have remained the seat of power in the \nThird Dynasty, but Heliopolis (the birthplace of  the Church of Ra) would have likely been the  religious epicentre of the country.\nWhether it was due to his  prowess as a scribe, a physician  or a budding engineer, Imhotep  eventually found himself  rubbing shoulders with people  from high places in King \nDjoser’s court. The Third-\nDynasty monarch was keen to  memorialise the legacy of his  royal house and reign long after  his death.

In order to hold the structure  in place, Imhotep used fine limestone (an expensive  commodity at the time) with packing in between. \nHe incorporated the basic design of the traditional  flat-roofed mastaba, but instead made each section  a square rather than a rectangle. Each ‘step’ was  constructed by building in accretion layers that leant  inwards towards the core of the structure (rather  than the flat, horizontal building technique used on  mastabas) – this design choice was crucial, since the  structure needed to be strong enough to hold itself in  place without imploding. Imhotep added a passageway  within the structure that led directly to the sarcophagus  chamber, as well as a complicated network of tunnels  and chambers. The pyramid itself was created as a  means of holding and protecting the king’s remains  and treasures, but it also formed a vital part of a larger  complex. A number of buildings, statues and pillars  were constructed on site, all of which were surrounded  by a stone wall that reached 10.7 metres (35 feet) high  and was encased in limestone. The treasures of the  king – 36,000 vessels filled with precious metals – were  lowered from above into chambers beneath the surface. \nThe chamber only had one opening, which was closed  off with a 3.5 ton block.\nPyramids of a polymath the king finally had a worthy tomb.

And that intimate  knowledge was what gave the Ancient Egyptian  healer the power to deal with almost any ailment.\n“When you come across a swelling of the flesh in  any part of the body of a patient and your patient  is clammy and the swelling comes and goes under  the finger,” reads the Ebers Papyrus (c. 1500 BCE)  in regards to diagnosing swelling and a potential  tumour, “then you must say to your patient: ‘It is a  tumour of the flesh. I will treat the disease. I will  try to heal it with fire since cautery heals’. When  you come across a swelling that has attacked a  channel, then it has formed a tumour in  the body. If when you examine it with  your fingers, it is like a hard stone,  then you should say: ‘It is a  tumour of the channels. I shall  treat the disease with a knife.’ ”\nThe use of fire remains an  alarming means of treating  any sort of swelling, but the  most striking element is the  bedside manner. Here we see  an aspect of Ancient Egyptian  medicine that’s often missing  from medical information from other  ancient cultures, and one that typifies  the importance of sages, healers and physicians  in Egyptian society. During this time, the mental  welfare of a patient was just as important as the  ailment affecting them physically.\nSurgery was another important factor of day- to-day Ancient Egyptian medical practice. More  importantly, it wasn’t a speciality as it is now,  but a necessity for every physician to know and  practise whenever and wherever it was needed.", "question": "According to the text, what important aspect of patient care was present in ancient Egyptian medicine that is often missing from other ancient cultures' medical information?", "answer": "The mental welfare of a patient was considered just as important as their physical ailment."}

It’s a written language that just seems  so very different to anything that we recognise in  modern times. The hieroglyphs attest to the human  capacity for invention, creative flair and the desire  to express as precisely as possible what we think  and feel about, and perceive in our immediate and  less immediate circumstances.

The  young Carter had no idea  who this king was, but he  felt the buzz surrounding  him, and the rumour that  somewhere in the vast desert of sand lay his tomb,  untouched and bursting full of precious ancient  treasures, alighted his boyish curiosity. \nAlthough he quickly rose through the ranks, \nCarter’s fiery and stubborn personality got the  better of him when he refused to apologise after  encouraging Egyptian guards to defend themselves  against French tourists who had assaulted  them. He left the Antiquities Service  for good and became a free agent. \nMeanwhile, Theodore M Davis, a  private sponsor of the Antiquities \nService, and his team had  made a curious discovery in  the Valley of the Kings. What  they had unearthed was a  small site with a few artefacts  bearing Tutankhamun’s name. \nThe discovery was decidedly  underwhelming, but Davis was  convinced he had finally discovered  the plundered tomb of the king. In his  publication, concerning the discovery he wrote, “I  fear the Valley of the Kings is now exhausted.” \nCarter did not agree. Now unemployed and  scraping a living by selling his paintings to wealthy  visitors, he hardly had the funds required to pursue  his suspicions that Davis’ discovery was not the  true tomb. But he was in luck. The lure of Egypt  and its many secrets had drawn in the wealthy but  frail George Herbert, Fifth Earl of Carnarvon. Both  men were eager to make a spectacular discovery,  and both men needed the other’s skills and  resources to do it. In 1909 they became a team, and  when Davis gave up the concession to excavate  in the Valley of the Kings in 1914, Carter and \nCarnarvon leapt at the chance. However, their peers  viewed the pair as idealistic and naive, warning  them that the only thing that would be discovered  in their search would likely be the bottom of the \nEarl’s wallet. \nUndeterred, Carter set about searching  for the tomb he thoroughly believed  existed. Initially interrupted by \nWorld War I, Carter was finally  free to continue the excavations  in 1917, working his way  from the surface down to the  bedrock of the valley floor. It  was long, exhausting work, and  it was estimated Carter’s team  moved 150,000 to 200,000 tons  of rubble in the relentless Egyptian  sun. But six seasons of digging later  and they had still found nothing. Carnarvon  was beginning to believe the critics were right.", "question": "When did Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon form their excavation team, and when did they take over the concession in the Valley of the Kings?", "answer": "They became a team in 1909, and took over the concession to excavate in the Valley of the Kings in 1914."}

However, this position  in itself provided a kind of spectacle, as the crowds  watched eagerly as an array of mysterious items  were removed from the tomb. Every day more and  more tourists poured into Luxor, and hotels even  set up tents in their gardens to accommodate the  unprecedented demand. \nOn 5 April 1923 disaster struck – Carnarvon was  dead.

Egypt was a culture that, to some degree,  combined an affinity for magic with a fascination for  the world of reason and evidence-based thought and  investigation. One of the key texts that survived the  immense passage of human history was The Book of  the Dead, dating from the 16th Dynasty, which was  discovered in the coffin of Queen Mentuhotep. The \nBook of the Dead is a narrative that provides us with  an insight into Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife. The  book powerfully combines writing and illustration for  a culture that embraced the sombre reality of death  and the ceaseless importance of a disciplined and  ordered life. The Book of the Dead comprises 200 spells  that were written to help the deceased negotiate the  challenges of reaching the afterlife.\n157\nDecoding the hieroglyphics\nThe hieroglyphic language of Ancient Egypt is  a time machine that takes us back to 5000 BCE  when the first versions of this language system  were marked by hunter communities in the \nWestern Desert of Egypt. In these very earliest  hieroglyphs we see depictions of cattle and farmers  and the motivation behind recording aspects of  their lives was to memorialise these details of life  that held most importance for them.\nKey to understanding hieroglyphs is recognising  that they function as ideograms. Ideograms are, as \nEgyptologist Ian Shaw explains, “signs employed as  direct representations of phenomena such as ‘sky’  or ‘man’) as well as phonetic signs representing the  sound of all or part of a spoken word…” \nHieroglyphs didn’t only provide factual  information. They also allowed for creative and  artistic expression and interpretation. Indeed,  some hieroglyphs are described as ‘determinative’  because a given hieroglyph determines the  full meaning. Hieroglyphs were most particularly  used on temples and the great public buildings  and monuments of Ancient Egypt.

{"context": "Over the next quarter of a century, English  and French scholars worked tirelessly to decode  the treasure. This type of scholarly competition  reflected something of the much broader tension  that had existed between France and Britain at the  time. In an attempt to weaken Britain, Napoleon  had decided on an offensive on British claims in \nEgypt in order to disrupt Britain’s hugely successful  venture in North Africa and emerging connections  to India.\nThe artefact was named the Rosetta Stone  after El Rashid – the location in the Nile Delta,  just about 35 miles north of Alexandria, where it  was discovered. And this inconspicuous chunk  of granite rock has become a globally recognised  archaeological treasure. Relatively swiftly after its  discovery, it granted access to the thought- and  idea-scape, daily life and religious systems of a  culture that has entranced and energised people’s  imaginations for centuries. The Rosetta Stone, then,  provided something of a quantum leap by allowing  scholars to understand with great clarity, and then  share, the story of Ancient Egypt. \nThe Stone itself did not narrate the history of \nAncient Egypt or anything equally expansive. No:  the stone itself records a public decree made by the  teenage pharaoh, Ptolemy V. However, this very  particular text would eventually allow translators to  work out the linguistic system on which Egyptian  writing was based. It became the key to unlocking  a long-lost corridor of knowledge through to the  time of the Ancient Egyptians. We use that term  to distinguish the culture from an even older  civilisation that had developed around the River \nNile. As Dr Penelope Wilson has commented, \n“Ancient Egyptian is classed by linguists as an \nAfro-Asiatic language. This means that it is related  to North African languages such as Berber and \nCushitic, and to Asiatic (or Semitic) languages, such  as Arabic and Hebrew.” \nIn 1810, the Royal Society of Antiquaries in \nLondon published a document entitled Rosetta \nStone, brought to England in 1802: account of by \nMatt. Raper.

Having been the capital  city of Ancient Egypt, Memphis was located just south  of the Nile Delta, 15 miles to the south of Cairo. The  contents of the decree refer to the young pharaoh \nPtolemy V, who the Greek text describes as  follows: “King Ptolemy, living for ever,  the Manifest God whose excellence  is fine…” It continues in Egyptian  hieroglyphs in the uppermost  section; the middle section shows \nDemotic Egyptian writing (used  for document writing rather than  writing about sacred subjects); and  the lowest third shows Ancient \nGreek text.
