Besides these fortunate travellers, however, there is another growing circle of those who are beginning to realize the significance of the early East in the history of man. As the Nile poured its life-giving waters into the broad bosom of the Mediterranean, so from the civilization of the wonderful people who so early emerged from barbarism on the Nile shores, there emanated and found their way to southern Europe rich and diversified influences of culture to which we of the western world are still indebted. Had the Euphrates flowed into the Mediterranean likewise, our debt to Babylon would have been correspondingly as great as that which we owe the Nile Valley.

For Egyptian religion as a whole, however, the author would acknowledge deep obligation to Erman’s admirable Handbuch, an obligation often indicated in the foot-notes, and elsewhere frequently evident to the technical reader. Although over twenty years old, Erman’s Aegypten is still the standard vade mecum on Egyptian life. It has often been of invaluable service in the production of this work. To Eduard Meyer’s exhaustive and final Chron- ologie I am, of course, indebted, especially in the earlier period. I would also gratefully acknowledge the clarify- ing influence of his incisive treatment of the Saitic age in his Geschichte des alten Aegyptens. To the colossal labors of Maspero and Wiedemann I have been indebted, especially in the bibliography, as indicated in the Preface to my Ancient Records, but I would gratefully indicate the obligation here also. Like all who work in Egyp- tian history, I also owe a debt to Winckler’s invaluable version of the Amarna Letters. For the illustrative materials, besides the published xiv PREFACE plates, frequently severally indicated, and his own photographs, the author would express his thanks to many friends and colleagues to whom he is indebted for photographs, drawings, or restorations. He is particu- larly indebted to his. friend Schaefer, of Berlin; also to Borchardt, Steindorff, Petrie, Zahn, Messerschmidt, Rev. W. MacGregor of Tamworth, and Dr. Caroline Ransom, for the unqualified use of photographs and reconstructions. To Messrs. Underwood & Underwood for permission to use a number of their superb stereo- graphs of Egyptian monuments 7n situ, I desire to express particular obligation. At the same time, may I add for the benefit of those to whom a journey through the Nile Valley is an impossibility, that the system of travel represented in these beautiful stereographsmakes possible to every one a voyage up the Nile which falls little short of the actual experience itself. Finally, I am not a little indebted to the great kindness of Mr. John Ward, of Lenoxvale, Belfast, for a magnificent series of photographs made specially for him, of recent excavations at Karnak, from which I was privileged to select a number, like the avenue of rams (Fig. 129).

Had the Euphrates flowed into the Mediterranean likewise, our debt to Babylon would have been correspondingly as great as that which we owe the Nile Valley. It is to Egypt that we must look as the dominant power in the Mediterranean basin, whether by force of arms or by sheer weight of superior civiliza- tion throughout the earliest career of man in southern Kurope, and for long after the archaic age had been supersededby higher culture. To us who are in civiliza- tion the children of early Europe, it is of vital interest to raise the curtain and peer beyond into the ages which bequeathed our forefathers so precious a legacy. Finally, vill PREFACE there is a third and possibly the most numerous class of those who desire an acquaintance with the history of Egypt, viz., the students of the Old Testament. All of these readers have been remembered in the composition of this book. The plan adopted in the production of this history is one which will in some measure also condition its use. The sources from which our knowledge of the early career of the Nile Valley peoples is drawn are of the meagerest extent, and most inadequate in character. They will be found further discussed herein (pp. 23 f.), and in the author’s Ancient Records of Egypt, Vol. I, pp. 3-22. As used at the present day, in the historical workshop of the scholar, they are accessible chiefly in published form. These publications were in the vast majority of cases edited before the attainment of such epigraphic accuracy and care as are now deemed in- dispensable in the production of such work.’ To copy an inscription of any kind with accuracy is not easy. So close and fine an observer of material documents as Ruskin could copy a short Latin inscription with sur- prising inaccuracy. In his incomparable Mornings in Florence he reproduces the brief inscription on the marble slab covering the tomb which he so admired in the church of Santa Croce; and in his copy of these eight short lines, which I compared with the original, he mis- spells ons word, and omits two entire words (‘‘et magister’’) of the medizval Latin.

PREFACE ix Politarch inscriptions appearedin eight different publica- tions, each of which diverges in some more or less im- portant respect from all the rest, before a correct copy was obtained. The Greek and Latin inscriptions on the bronze crab from the base of the New York Obelisk were long incorrectly read, and the mistake in the date led Mommsen to a false theory of the early Roman prefects of Egypt. In the early days of Egyptology, when a reading knowledge of hieroglyphic was still necessarily elementary, it required a copyist of ex- ceptional ability to produce a copy upon which much reliance can be placed at the present day. Had the science of Egyptology rapidly outgrown this early in- sufficiency, all would now be well; but such methods have continued down to the present day, and although many exhaustively accurate publications of hieroglyphic documents now appear with every year, it is neverthe- less true that the large majority of standard Egyptian documents accessible in publications exhibit a degree of incompleteness and inaccuracy not, in the author’s judgment, to be found in any other branch of epigraphic science. 3 Under these circumstances the author’s first obliga- tion has been to go behind the publications to the original monument itself in every possible instance. This task has consumed years and demanded protracted sojourn among the great collections of Europe. In this work a related enterprise has been of the greatest assistance. A mission to the museums of Europe to collect their Egyptian monuments for a Commission of the four Royal Academies of Germany (Berlin, Leipzig, Goettingen, and Munich), in order to make these documents available x PREFACE for a great Egyptian Dictionary endowed by the German Emperor, enabled the author to copy from the originals practically all the historical monuments of Egypt in Europe.", "question": "What historical theory was mistakenly formed due to an incorrect reading of inscriptions on the New York Obelisk's bronze crab?", "answer": "The incorrect reading of the Greek and Latin inscriptions on the bronze crab from the base of the New York Obelisk led Mommsen to a false theory regarding the early Roman prefects of Egypt."}

{"context": "PREFACE x4 any older translation or account of a document was consulted. The combined results of the revised copies from the originals and the new grammatical study of the documents have been embodied in a series of trans- lations of the historical documents, arranged in chrono- logical order, beginning with the earliest surviving records and continuing to the final loss of Egyptian national independence at the conquest by the Persians in 525 B.C. Supplied with historical introductions and explanatory notes, the original documents, otherwise scattered through hundreds on hundreds of inaccessible publications, are thus accessible in English to the reader who desires to know upon what documentary evidence a particular assertion of fact rests. The numerals I, I, III, and IV in the foot-notes in this history refer to the volumes of these translations, and the Arabic numerals following the four Romans designate the numbered paragraphs into which the translations are divided, unless the ‘“‘p.,” indicating ‘‘page,” is inserted between. It is hoped that, by this means of keeping all technical discussion of sources in the four volumes of translated documents, the author has succeeded in unburdening this history of the workshop débris, which would other- wise often encumber it; while at the same time the advantage of close contact with the sources for every fact adduced is not sacrificed.

At the same time in both the northern and southern Asiatic dominions of the Pharaoh, an overflow of Beduin immigration, among which were undoubtedly some of the tribes which later coalesced with the Israelites, aggravated the danger, and together with the persistent advance of the Hittites, finally resulted in the complete dissolution of the Asiatic empire of Egypt, down to the very frontier of the northeastern Delta. Meanwhile the internal disorders had caused the fall of the Highteenth Dynasty, an event which terminated the First Period of the Empire (1350 B. C.). Harmhab, one of the able commanders under the fallen dynasty, survived the crisis and finally seized the throne. Under his vigourous rule the disorganized nation was grad- ually restored to order, and his successors of the Nineteenth Dynasty (1350-1205 B. C.) were able to begin the recovery of the lost empire in Asia. But the Hittites were too firmly entrenched in Syria to yield to the Egyptian onset. The assaults of Seti I, and half a generation of persistent campaigning under Ramses II, failed to push the northern frontier of the Empire far beyond the limits of Palestine. Here it remained and Syria was never permanently recov- ered. Semitic influences now powerfully affected Egypt. Fic. 6.—A TRIPLE SHADUF.

{"context": "Now and then an aggressive and able ruler gained the ascendency for a brief reign, and under one of these the subjugation of Upper Nubia was carried forward to a point above the third cat- aract; but his conquest perished with him. After possibly a century of such internal conflict, the country was entered and appropriated by a line of rulers from Asia, who had seemingly already gained a wide dominion there. These foreign usurpers, now known as the Hyksos, after Manetho’s designation of them, maintained themselves for perhaps a century. Their residence was at Avaris in the eastern Delta, and at least durmg the later part of their supremacy, the Egyptian nobles of the South succeeded in gaining more or less independence. Finally the head of a Theban family boldly proclaimed himself king, and in the course of some years these Theban princes succeeded in expelling the Hyksos from the country, and driving them back from the Asiatic frontier into Syria. It was under the Hyksos and in the struggle with them that the conservatism of millennia was broken up in the Nile valley. The Egyptians learned aggressive war for the first time, and introduced a well organized military system, including chariotry, which the importation of the horse by the Hyksos now enabled them to do. Egypt was trans- formed into a military empire. In the struggle with the Hyksos and with each other, the old feudal families perished, or were absorbed among the partisans of the dominant Theban family, from which the imperial line sprang.

In spite of the wide extent of marshy ground, left stagnating by the inundation, the dry airs of the desert, blowing constantly across the valley, quickly dry the soil, and there is never any malarial infection in Upper Egypt. Even in the vast morass of the Delta, malaria is practically unknown. Thus, lying just outside of the tropics, Egypt enjoyed a mild climate of unsurpassed salubrity, devoid of the harshness of a northern winter, but at the same time sufficiently cool to escape those enervating influences inherent in tropical conditions. The prospect of this contracted valley spread out before the Nile dweller, was in antiquity, as it is to-day, somewhat monotonous. The level Nile bottoms, the gift of the river, clad in rich green, shut in on either hand by the yellow cliffs, are unrelieved by any elevations or by any forests, save the occasional groves of graceful palms, which fringe the river banks or shade the villages of sombre mud huts (Fig. 4), with now and then a sycamore, a tamarisk or an acacia. <A network of irrigation canals traverses the country in every direction like a vast arterial system. The sands of the deso- late wastes which lie behind the cafion walls, drift in athwart the cliffs, and often invade the green fields so that one may stand with one foot in the verdure of the valley, and the other in the desert sand. Thus sharply defined was the Egyptian’s world: a deep and narrow valley of unparalleled fertility, winding between lifeless deserts, furnishing a remarkable environment, not to be found elsewhere in all the world. Such surroundings reacted powerfully upon the mind and thought of the Egyptian, conditioning and deter- mining his idea of the world and his notion of the mysterious powers which ruled it.

Nowhere on earth have the witnesses of a great, but now extinct civilization, been so plentifully preserved as along the banks of the Nile. Even in the Delta, where the storms of war beat more fiercely than in the valley above, and where the slow accumulations from the yearly flood have gradually entombed them, the splendid cities of the Pharaohs have left great stretches, cumbered with enormous blocks of granite, limestone and sandstone, shattered obelisks, and massive pylon bases, to proclaim the wealth and power of forgotten ages; while an ever growing multitude of modern visitors are drawn to the upper valley by the colossal ruins that greet the wondering traveller almost at every bend in the stream.", "question": "What two primary geographical divisions did the ancient Egyptians use to describe their world?", "answer": "The ancient Egyptians viewed their world as primarily composed of the \"Black Land\" (the fertile Nile valley) and the \"Red Land\" (the surrounding reddish desert)."}

A vast and elaborate system of irrigation canals and reservoirs first receives the flood, which is then allowed to escape into the fields as needed. Here it rests long enough to deposit its burden of rich, black earth from the upper reaches of the Blue Nile. At such times the appearance of the country is picturesque in the extreme, the glistening surface of the waters being dotted here and there by the vivid green of the waving palm groves, which mark the villages, now accessible only along the dykes _ belonging to the irrigation system (Fig. 2). Thus year by year, the soil which would otherwise become impoverished in the elements necessary to the production of such prodi- gious harvests, is invariably replenished with fresh resources. As the river sinks below the level of the fields again, it is necessary to raise the water from the canals by artificial means, in order to carry on the constant irrigation of the growing crops in the outlying fields, which are too high to be longer refreshed by absorption from the river (Fig. 6).! Thus a genial and generous, but exacting soil, demanded for its cultivation the development of a high degree of skill *The device used (called a “shadfif”) resembles the well-sweep of our grandfathers. Fig. 6 shows the leathern bucket suspended from one end of the sweep, while at the other end a huge lump of dried mud serves as a counter- poise.

{"context": "Egyptian intercourse from age to age, and reciprocal influences ensue; until in the thirteenth century B. C. the peoples of southern Europe, long discernible in their material civilization, emerge in the written documents of Egypt for the first time in history. It was then that the fortunes of the Pharaohs began to decline, and as the civili- zation and power, first of the East and then of classic Europe, slowly developed, Egypt was finally submerged in the great world of Mediterranean powers, first dominated by Persia, and then by Greece and Rome. The career of the races which peopled the Nile valley falls into a series of more or less clearly marked epochs, each of which is rooted deeply in that which preceded it, and itself contains the germs of that which is to follow. A more or less arbitrary and artificial but convenient sub-division of these epochs, beginning with the historic age, is furnished by the so-called dynasties of Manetho. This native historian 18 14 A HISTORY OF EGYPT of Egypt, a priest of Sebennytos, who flourished under Ptolemy I (305-285 B. C.), wrote a history of his country in the Greek language. The work has perished, and we only know it in an epitome by Julius Africanus and Eusebius, and extracts by Josephus. The value of the work was slight, as it was built up on folk-tales and popular traditions of the early kings. Manetho divided the long succession of Phar- aohs as known to him, into thirty royal houses or dynas- ties, and although we know that many of his divisions are arbitrary, and that there was many a dynastic change where he indicates none, yet his dynasties divide the kings into convenient groups, which have so long been employed in modern study of Egyptian history, that it is now impossible to dispense with them. After an archaic age of primitive civilization, and a period of small and local kingdoms, the various centres of civiliza- tion on the Nile gradually coalesced into two kingdoms: one comprising the valley down to the Delta; and the other made up of the Delta itself. In the Delta, civilization rap- idly advanced, and the calendar year of 365 days was intro- duced in 4241 B. C., the earliest fixed date in the history of the world as known to us.!

He divided the succession of Pharaohs into thirty dynasties, which, despite being arbitrary in some divisions, are still used in modern study of Egyptian history."}

It is more- over a completed product as observable in our earliest pre- served examples of it; but the fusion of the Libyans and 25 26 A HISTORY OF EGYPT east Africans with the Nile valley peoples continued far into historic times, and in the case of the Libyans may be traced in ancient historical documents for three thousand years or more. The Semitic immigration from Asia, examples of which are also observable in the historic age, occurred in an epoch that lies far below our remotest historical horizon. We shall never be able to determine when, nor with cer- tainty through what channels it took place, although the most probable route is that along which we may observe a similar influx from the deserts of Arabia in historic times, the isthmus of Suez, by which the Mohammedan invasion entered the country. While the Semitic language which they brought with them, left its indelible impress upon the old Nile valley people, the nomadic life of the desert which the invaders left behind them, evidently was not so persis- tent, and the religion of Egypt, that element of life which always receives the stamp of its environment, shows no trace of desert life. The affinities observable in the language are confirmed in case of the Libyans, by the surviving products of archaic civilization in the Nile valley, such as some of the early pottery, which closely resembles that still made by the Libyan Kabyles. Again the representations of the early Puntites, or Somali people, on the Egyptian monuments, show striking resemblances to the Egyptians themselves. The examination of the bodies exhumed from archaic burials in the Nile valley, which we had hoped might bring further evidence for the settlement of the problem, has, however, produced such diversity of opinion among the physical anthropologists, as to render it impossible for the historian to obtain decisive results from their researches. The conclu- sion once maintained by some historians, that the Egyptian was of African negro origin, is now refuted; and evidently indicated that at most he may have been slightly tinctured with negro blood, in addition to the other ethnic elements already mentioned.

On the thirtieth anniversary of his appointment by his father as crown-prince to the heirship of the kingdom, the king cele- brated a great jubilee called the ‘‘Feast of Sed,’’ a word meaning ‘‘tail,’’ and perhaps commemorating his assump- tion of the royal lion’s tail at his appointment thirty years before. He was a mighty hunter, and recorded with pride an achievement like the slaying of a hippopotamus. His weapons were costly and elaborate as we shall see. His sev- eral palaces each bore a name, and the royal estate possessed gardens and vineyards, the latter being also named and carefully administered by officials who were responsible for the income therefrom. The furniture of such a palace, even in this remote age was magnificent and of fine artistic quality. Among it were vessels exquisitely wrought in some eighteen or twenty different varieties of stone, especially alabaster (Fig. 14); even in such refractory material as diorite, superb bowls were ground to translucent thinness, and jars of rock crystal were carved with matchless precision to represent natural objects. The pottery, on the other hand, perhaps because of the perfection of the stone vessels, is inferior to that of the predynastic age. The less substantial furniture has for the most part perished, but chests of ebony inlaid with ivory and stools with legs of ivory magnificently carved to represent bull’s legs (Fig. 15), have survived in fragments. Glaze was now more thoroughly mastered than before, and incrustation with glazed plaques and ivory tablets was practiced.

{"context": "The revenue in food and wine from certain of the king’s estates was diverted — and established as permanent income of the tomb to maintain for all time the table supply of the deceased king and of his household and adherents, whose tombs to the number of one or two hundred were grouped about his own. Thus he was surrounded in death by those who had been his companions in life; his women, his body-guard, and even the dwarf, whose dances had diverted his idle hours, all sleep beside their lord that he may continue in the hereafter the state with which he had been environed on earth. Thus early began the elaborate arrangements of the Egyptian upper classes for the proper maintenance of the deceased in the life hereafter. This desire to create a permanent abiding place for the royal dead exerted a powerful influence in the development of the art of building. Already in the First Dynasty we find 42 A HISTORY OF EGYPT a granite floor in one of the royal tombs, that of Usephais, and toward the end of the Second Dynasty the surrounding brick chambers of king Khasekhemui’s tomb enclose a chamber built of hewn limestone, the earliest stone masonry structure known in the history of man (Fig. 25). His pred- ecessor, probably his father, had already built a stone temple which he recorded as a matter of note, and Khasekhemui himself built a temple at Hieraconpolis, of which a granite doorpost has survived. Such works of the skilled artificer and builder (for a number of royal architects were already attached to the court) indicate a well-ordered and highly organized state; but of its character little can be discerned from the scanty materials at our command. The king’s chief assistant and minister in government seems to have been a chancellor, whom we have seen attending him on state occasions. The officials whom we later find as nobles with judicial functions, attached to the two royal residences of the North and South, Pe and Nekhen, already existed under these earliest dynas- ties, indicating an organized administration of judicial and juridical affairs. There was a body of fiscal officials, whose seals we find upon payments of naturalia to the royal tombs, impressed upon the clay jar-sealings; while a fragment of a scribe’s accounts evidently belonging to such an adminis- tration, was found in the Abydos royal tombs.", "question": "What historical innovation in construction resulted from the desire for permanent royal tombs in early Egypt?", "answer": "The desire for permanent royal tombs in early Egypt led to advancements in building art, culminating in the earliest known stone masonry structure, found in King Khasekhemui's tomb by the end of the Second Dynasty."}

Crude statuettes in wood, ivory, or stone, represent the beginnings of that plastic art, which was to achieve such triumphs in the early dynastic age; and three large stone statues of Min, found by Petrie at Coptos, display the rude strength of the predynastic civilization of which we are now speak- ing. The art of the prolific potter was obliged to give way slowly to the artificer in stone, who finally produced excel- lent stone vessels, which he gradually improved toward the end of predynastic period, when his bowls and jars in the hardest stones, like the diorites and porphyries, display mag- nificent work. The most cunningly wrought flints that have ever been found among any people belong to this age. The makers were ultimately able to affix carved ivory hafts, and with equal skill they put together stone and flint axes, flint- headed fish-spears and the like. The war mace with pear- shaped head, as found also in Babylonia, is characteristic of the age.

{"context": "While they thus early possessed all the rudiments of material culture, the people of this age developed a system of writing also. The computations necessary for the dis- covery and use of the calendar show a use of writing in the last centuries of the fifth millennium B. C. It is shown also by the fact that nearly a thousand years later the scribes of the Fifth Dynasty were able to copy a long list of the kings of the North, and perhaps those of the South also (Fig. 29) ; while the mortuary texts to which we have referred will not have survived a thousand years without having been com- mitted to writing in the same way. The hieroglyphs for the Northern Kingdom, for its king, and for its treasury can not have arisen at one stroke with the first king of the dynastic age; but must have been in use long before the rise of the First Dynasty; while the presence of a cursive linear hand at the beginning of the dynasties is conclusive evidence that the system was not then a recent innovation. Of the deeds of these remote kings of the North and South, who passed away before three thousand four hundred B. C. we know nothing. Their tombs have never been discovered, a fact which accounts for the lack of any written monuments 36 A HISTORY OF EGYPT among the contemporary documents, all of which come from tombs of the poorer classes, such as contain no writing even in the dynastic age.

But as the ‘‘numberings’’ finally became an- nual, they formed a more convenient basis for designating the year, as habit seemed to have deterred the scribes from num- bering the years themselves. Side by side with this official year, there was doubtless a civil year which followed the sea- sons, and the lunar months continued to be the basis of tem- ple payments and of many business transactions, although HARLIEST EGYPT 45 it is not probable that a lunar year had ever existed. Such a system of government and administration as this of course could not operate without a method of writing, which we find in use both in elaborate hieroglyphics (Fig. 27) and in the rapid cursive hand of the accounting scribe. It already pos- sessed not only phonetic signs representing a whole syllable or group of consonants but also the alphabetic signs, each of which stood for one consonant; true alphabetic letters having thus been discovered in Kgypt two thousand five hundred years before their use by any other people. Had the Egyptian been less a creature of habit, he might have discarded his syllabic signs 3,500 years before Christ, and have written with an alphabet of twenty four letters. In the documents of these early dynasties the writing is in such an archaic form that many of the scanty fragments which we possess from this age are as yet unintelligible to us. Yet it was the medium of recording medical and religious texts, to which in later times a peculiar sanctity and effect- iveness were attributed. The chief events of each year were also recorded in a few lines under its name, and a series of annals covering every year of a king’s reign and showing to a day how long he reigned, was thus produced. <A small fragment only of these annals has escaped destruction, the now famous Palermo Stone,' so called because it is at present in the museum of Palermo (Fig. 29).? Already a state form of religion was developing, and it is this form alone of which we know anything; the religion of the people having left little or no trace. Even in the later dynasties we shall find little to say of the folk-religion, which was rarely a matter of permanent record.

He was a mighty hunter, and recorded with pride an achievement like the slaying of a hippopotamus. His weapons were costly and elaborate as we shall see. His sev- eral palaces each bore a name, and the royal estate possessed gardens and vineyards, the latter being also named and carefully administered by officials who were responsible for the income therefrom. The furniture of such a palace, even in this remote age was magnificent and of fine artistic quality. Among it were vessels exquisitely wrought in some eighteen or twenty different varieties of stone, especially alabaster (Fig. 14); even in such refractory material as diorite, superb bowls were ground to translucent thinness, and jars of rock crystal were carved with matchless precision to represent natural objects.

The less substantial furniture has for the most part perished, but chests of ebony inlaid with ivory and stools with legs of ivory magnificently carved to represent bull’s legs (Fig. 15), have survived in fragments.

The kings were constantly laying out new estates and build- ing new palaces, temples and strongholds. Public works, like the opening of irrigation canals (Fig. 18) or the wall of Menes above Memphis, show their solicitude for the eco- nomic resources of the kingdom, as well as a skill in engi- neering and a high conception of government such as we can not but greatly admire in an age so remote. They were able also to undertake the earliest enterprises of which we know in foreign lands. King Semerkhet, early in the dynastic age, and probably during the First Dynasty, car- ried on mining operations in the copper regions of the Sinaitic peninsula, in the Wadi Maghara.

EARLY RELIGION 67 ‘‘They depart not as those who are dead, but they depart as those who are living.’’! Here there entered, as a salutary influence also the incident of the triumphant vindication of Osiris when accused; for there is a hint of a similar justi- fication for all, which, as we shall yet see, was the most fruit- ful germ in Egyptian religion. The myth of Osiris thus in- troduced an ultimately powerful ethical element, which, while not altogether lacking before, needed the personal factor supplied by the Osiris myth to give it vital force. Thus sev- eral nobles of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties threaten those who in the future would appropriate their tombs, that ‘‘judg- ment shall be had with them for it by the great god’’;? and another says that he never slandered others, for ‘‘I desired that it might be well with me in the great god’s presence.’’? These views are chiefly found in the oldest mortuary liter- ature of Egypt which we possess, a series of texts supposed to be effective in securing for the deceased the enjoyment of a happy life, and especially the blessed future enjoyed by Osiris. They were engraved upon the passages of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasty pyramids, where they have been preserved in large numbers, and it is largely from them that the above sketch of the early Egyptian’s notions of the hereafter has been taken.

It is accompanied by the inscription: ‘‘ First occurrence of smiting the Easterners.’’ This designation of the event as the ‘‘first occurrence’’ would indicate that it was a customary thing for the kings of the time to chastise these barbarians, and that therefore he was expecting a ‘‘second occurrence,’’ as a matter of course. A ‘‘smiting of the Troglodytes,’’ the same people, recorded on the Pa- lermo Stone? in the First Dynasty, doubtless falls in the reign of king Miebis.

EARLY RELIGION 63 “‘Great Seer’’; while he of Ptah at Memphis was called ‘‘Great Chief of Artificers.’’ Both positions demanded two incumbents at once and were usually held by men of high rank. The incumbents of the other high priesthoods of later origin all bore the simple title of ‘‘overseer or chief of priests.’’ It was the duty of this man not merely to conduct the service and ritual of the sanctuary, but also to administer its endowment of lands, from the income of which it lived, while in time of war he might even command the temple contingent. He was assisted by a body of priests, whose sacerdotal service was with few exceptions merely incidental to their worldly occupations. They were laymen, who from time to time served for a stated period in the temple; thus in spite of the fiction of the Pharaoh as the sole worshipper of the god, the laymen were represented in its service. In the same way the women of the time were commonly priestesses of Neit or Hathor; their service con- sisted in nothing more than dancing and jingling a sistrum before the god on festive occasions. The state fiction had therefore not quite suppressed the participation of the indi- vidual in the service of the temple. In harmony with the conception of the temple as the god’s dwelling the most fre- quent title of the priest was ‘‘servant of the god.”’ Parallel with this development of a state religion, with its elaborate equipment of temple, endowment, priesthood and ritual, the evolution of the provision for the dead had kept even pace. In no land, ancient or modern, has there ever been such attention to the equipment of the dead for their eternal sojourn in the hereafter. The beliefs which finally led the Egyptian to the devotion of so much of his wealth and time, his skill and energy to the erection and equipment of the ‘‘eternal house’’ are the oldest conceptions of a real life hereafter of which we know. He believed that the body was animated by a vital force, which he pictured as a coun- terpart of the body, which came into the world with it, passed through life in its company, and accompanied it into the next world.

He was the patron of the artisan, the artificer and artist, and his High Priest was always the chief artist of the court. Such were the chief gods of Egypt, although many another important deity pre- sided in this or that temple, whom it would be impossible for us to notice here, even with a word. The external manifestations and the symbols with which the Egyptian clothed these gods are of the simplest char- acter and they show the primitive simplicity of the age in which these deities arose. They bear a staff like a Beduin native of to-day, or the goddesses wield a reed-stem; their diadems are of woven reeds or a pair of ostrich feathers, or the horns of a sheep. In such an age, the people frequently saw the manifestations of their gods in the numerous ani- mals with which they were surrounded, and the veneration of these sacred beasts survived into an age of high civiliza- tion, when we should have expected it to disappear. But the animal-worship, which we usually associate with ancient Egypt, as a cult, is a late product, brought forward in the decline of the nation at the close of its history. In the periods with which we shall have to deal, it was unknown; the hawk, for example, was the sacred animal of the sun-god, and as such a living hawk might have a place in the temple, where he was fed and kindly treated, as any such pet might be; but he was not worshipped, nor wag he the object of an elaborate ritual as later.* * Erman, Handbuch, p. 25. EARLY RELIGION 61 In their elongated valley the local beliefs of the earliest Egyptians could not but differ greatly among themselves, and although for example there were many centres of sun- worship, each city possessing a sun-temple regarded the sun as its particular god, to the exclusion of all the rest; just as many a town of Italy at the present day would not for a moment identify its particular Madonna with the virgin of any other town. As commercial and administrative inter- course were increased by political union, these mutually con- tradictory and incompatible beliefs could not longer remain local.
